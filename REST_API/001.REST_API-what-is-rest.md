✨ **What is REST**
- → REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
- → It is a set of principles or architectural guidelines.
- → HTTP is commonly used to implement these guidelines.
- → **First Principle: Uniform Interface and Easy Access**
    - → CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are performed using HTTP methods (verbs).
    - → **HTTP Methods (Verbs):**
        - → `POST`: Used to create a resource (e.g., `POST /employees`). Returns `201 Created`.
        - → `GET`: Used to read a resource (e.g., `GET /employees/{id}`). Returns `200 OK`.
        - → `PUT`: Used to update a complete object (e.g., `PUT /employees/{id}`).
        - → `PATCH`: Used for partial updates of an object (e.g., `PATCH /employees/{id}`).
        - → `DELETE`: Used to delete a resource (e.g., `DELETE /employees/{id}`).
    - → **URIs (Nouns):** HTTP provides URIs to easily identify any resource.
- → **Second Principle: Support Multiple Formats**
    - → RESTful Web services or APIs should support multiple data formats (e.g., XML, JSON, text).
- → **Summary:**
    - → REST is a combination of principles/architectural guidelines, mainly having a single interface.
    - → HTTP is a great way to implement REST due to its methods (verbs) and URIs (easy access).
    - → It should support multiple representations (different data types).
