✨ **How to Dockerize a Spring Boot Application**
- → **Step 1: Create a Dockerfile:** Create a file named `Dockerfile` (no extension) in the project root.
- → **Step 2: Specify Base Image:** The first instruction in the Dockerfile specifies the base image (e.g., `openjdk:17-jdk-slim`).
- → **Step 3: Add JAR File:** Copy the Spring Boot executable JAR file (typically found in the `target` or build directory) into the Docker image.
    - → **Example:** `COPY target/your-application.jar app.jar`
- → **Step 4: Define Entry Point:** The last instruction defines the entry point, which is the command to be run as soon as the container starts.
    - → This command typically executes the JAR file.
    - → **Example:** `ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]`
- → This setup ensures that when a container is launched from this image, the Spring Boot application inside it will automatically start.
