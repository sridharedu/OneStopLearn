✨ **Docker Components and Workflow**
- → **Docker Repository/Registry:** Centralized storage for all Docker images.
- → **Docker Host:** The machine where the Docker engine is installed.
- → **Docker Client:** Provides the ability to run commands against the Docker engine.
- → **Typical Workflow:**
    - → When a `docker pull` command is executed, the Docker engine first checks for the image locally.
    - → If not found locally, it pulls the image from the central Docker repository and stores it locally.
    - → When a `docker run` command is executed, the Docker engine uses the locally available image to launch a container.
    - → Users can create their own Docker images from their applications, build them, and push them to the central Docker repository for others to use.
