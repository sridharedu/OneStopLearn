✨ **What are Docker Volumes**
- → When a Docker container is deleted, the application data on that container is also deleted or lost.
- → To persist this data onto the host machine where Docker is running, `Bind mounts` or `Volumes` can be used.
- → Bind mounts and volumes are essentially folders on the host machine that are bound or mounted to a folder inside the container.
- → This ensures that data is stored on the host machine instead of within the container itself.
- → Even if the container is deleted, the data remains on the host machine.
- → The next time a new container is launched from the same Docker image, it can continue to use and update the data on the host machine through this volume or bind mount.
