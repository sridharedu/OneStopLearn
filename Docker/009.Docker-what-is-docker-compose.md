✨ **What is Docker Compose**
- → Docker Compose is a tool used to define and run multi-container Docker applications.
- → It allows bringing up or taking down multiple Docker containers that depend on each other in one shot.
- → **Example:** If a product microservice uses a coupon microservice, and both depend on a MySQL database, all three can be defined and managed together.
- → **Docker Compose File:** Services (containers) are defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file.
    - → This file specifies container information such as the image to use, restart policies, exposed ports, and environment variables.
    - → Services can declare dependencies on each other.
- → **Workflow:** When `docker compose up` is run using this file:
    - → The Docker MySQL container will be launched first.
    - → Then the Coupon microservice container will be launched.
    - → Finally, the Product microservice container will be launched, as it depends on the other two.
- → Docker Compose simplifies the management of interconnected containers, allowing them to be launched and taken down with single commands.
