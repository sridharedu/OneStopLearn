✨ **What is Docker**
- → Docker is a containerization tool or framework that allows packaging applications once and running them anywhere.
- → It implements the Open Container Initiative (OCI) standard.
- → When an application is Dockerized, it no longer exists as traditional artifacts (WAR, JAR, DLL, Django code), but as a `Docker image`.
- → A Docker image contains the entire infrastructure information along with the application itself.
- → From a Docker image, any number of `containers` can be launched on any operating system that has Docker installed.
- → Components can be put into different images (e.g., DB server, web server, application), and separate containers can be launched from these images to communicate with each other.
