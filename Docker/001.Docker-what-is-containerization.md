✨ **What is Containerization**
- → To launch a Java software application, traditionally requires a physical/virtual machine, operating system, JDK, and application server (e.g., JBoss, WebLogic).
- → This traditional process can be time-consuming and expensive.
- → Containerization allows creating an abstract representation of all these software components, including the application itself.
- → An `image` is created, which is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software.
- → Once an image is created, any number of `containers` can be launched from it for the application and its required software, easily and quickly, in any environment.
