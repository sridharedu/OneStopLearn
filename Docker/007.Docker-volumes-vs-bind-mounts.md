✨ **Volumes vs Bind Mounts**
- → **Bind Mounts:**
    - → Can be any folder on the host machine.
    - → Not managed by Docker.
    - → Any process on the host machine can have direct access to these folders.
- → **Volumes:**
    - → Managed objects controlled by Docker.
    - → Live under a specific directory within Docker's managed space.
    - → No other process on the host machine will have direct access to these volumes, providing better isolation and management.
