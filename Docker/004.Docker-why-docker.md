✨ **Why Docker**
- → Docker uses the concept of `image layers` and `overlay filesystem`.
- → A Docker image is made up of multiple layers.
- → It uses a union filesystem to integrate these layers together.
- → When an image is first pulled, it pulls several layers, starting with the base kernel, and then merges/overlays them.
- → Subsequent pulls of the same image only pull the layers that have changed.
- → **Example:** If only the application JAR/WAR has changed, only that specific layer will be pulled and overlaid on top of the existing layers.
- → This improves performance and reduces network bandwidth.
