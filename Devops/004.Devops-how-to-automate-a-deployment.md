✨ **How to Automate a Deployment with Jenkins**
- → **Step 1: Create Jenkinsfile:** Create a `Jenkinsfile` containing all the build stages for the project.
- → **Step 2: Push to GitHub:** Push this `Jenkinsfile` to the project directory in GitHub.
- → **Step 3: Configure GitHub Webhook:** Create a webhook on GitHub that pushes events to the Jenkins job.
- → **Step 4: Trigger Jenkins Job:** Whenever a commit happens on the project, the Jenkins job is automatically triggered.
- → **Step 5: Run Build:** The build runs through all defined stages (build, test, deploy) and automatically deploys the application to the desired environment.
