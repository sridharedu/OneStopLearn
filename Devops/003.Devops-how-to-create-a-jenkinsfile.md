✨ **How to Create a Jenkinsfile**
- → A Jenkinsfile is a Groovy script.
- → It starts with `pipeline` at the top.
- → The first element inside the pipeline is the `agent`, specifying where the build can be run.
- → It includes multiple build `stages` (e.g., build, test, deploy).
- → Each stage can have multiple `steps` to build and deploy projects.
