✨ **Continuous Integration vs Delivery vs Deployment**
- → **Continuous Integration (CI):**
    - → Involves writing several tests that run every time a new commit happens.
    - → Ensures the application still works as expected after code changes.
    - → Focuses on integrating code changes frequently and verifying them automatically.
- → **Continuous Delivery (CD):**
    - → Extends Continuous Integration.
    - → Runs production-like tests in a staging environment, getting the application close to production readiness.
    - → May still involve some manual steps (e.g., manual tests that cannot be automated, manager approvals).
- → **Continuous Deployment (CD):**
    - → Extends Continuous Delivery by eliminating all manual steps.
    - → As soon as code is committed and passes all automated tests across various environments (testing, staging), the application automatically goes to production.
