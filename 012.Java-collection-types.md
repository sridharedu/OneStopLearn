ðŸ“¦ **Collection Interfaces**
- â†’ **`List`**: An ordered collection that allows duplicate elements.
  - â†’ `ArrayList`: Resizable array implementation. Fast for random access.
  - â†’ `LinkedList`: Doubly-linked list implementation. Fast for insertions and deletions.
- â†’ **`Set`**: A collection that does not allow duplicate elements.
  - â†’ `HashSet`: Uses a hash table for storage. Offers best performance.
  - â†’ `LinkedHashSet`: Maintains insertion order.
  - â†’ `TreeSet`: A `SortedSet` implementation that stores elements in sorted order.
- â†’ **`Queue`**: A collection used to hold elements prior to processing (First-In, First-Out - FIFO).
  - â†’ `PriorityQueue`: Orders elements based on their natural order or a custom comparator.
- â†’ **`BlockingQueue`**: A sub-interface of `Queue` that supports operations that wait for the queue to become non-empty when retrieving an element, and wait for space to become available in the queue when storing an element. Useful for producer-consumer patterns.
- â†’ **`Map`**: An object that maps keys to values. Does not allow duplicate keys.
  - â†’ `HashMap`: The most commonly used implementation. Does not guarantee order.
  - â†’ `LinkedHashMap`: Maintains insertion order of keys.
  - â†’ `TreeMap`: A `SortedMap` implementation that keeps entries sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys.
