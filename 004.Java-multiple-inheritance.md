💎 **Multiple Inheritance**
- → Java does not support extending more than one class (multiple inheritance) to avoid ambiguity.

🤔 **The Ambiguity Problem**
- → If a class inherits from two parent classes that have methods with the same name and signature, the compiler doesn't know which one to use.
- → This is often called the "Deadly Diamond of Death" or "Diamond Problem."
- → Attempting to do this will result in a compile-time error.

```java
class Father {
    void money() {
        System.out.println("Father's money.");
    }
}

class Mother {
    void money() {
        System.out.println("Mother's money.");
    }
}

// This is not allowed in Java and will cause a compile error.
class ConfusedKid extends Father, Mother {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConfusedKid kid = new ConfusedKid();
        kid.money(); // Which one to call? Father's or Mother's?
    }
}
```

💍 **The Diamond Problem**
- → A more complex version of the ambiguity problem.
- → It occurs when a class `D` inherits from two classes `B` and `C`, and both `B` and `C` inherit from a single class `A`.
- → If `A` has a method that `B` and `C` override, `D` has an ambiguous choice of which overridden method to inherit.
