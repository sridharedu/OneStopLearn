ü§ù **Implementing Interfaces with Same Method**
- ‚Üí A class can implement two or more interfaces that have methods with the exact same signature.
- ‚Üí This does not cause the "Diamond Problem" seen with multiple inheritance of classes.
- ‚Üí The implementing class simply provides a single implementation for the shared method, which satisfies the contract for all interfaces.

```java
interface Car {
    void go();
    void stop();
}

interface Driverless {
    void sitDownAndRelax();
    void go(); // Same method signature as in Car
}

class Honda implements Car, Driverless {
    // A single implementation for the go() method satisfies both interfaces.
    @Override
    public void go() {
        System.out.println("Honda is going.");
    }

    @Override
    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Honda has stopped.");
    }

    @Override
    public void sitDownAndRelax() {
        System.out.println("Sit back and relax, the car is driving itself.");
    }
}
```
