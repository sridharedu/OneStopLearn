üìÅ **File API Updates (Java 11)**
- ‚Üí Java 11 simplifies reading from and writing to files with new static methods on the `java.nio.file.Files` class.
- ‚Üí **`writeString(Path, CharSequence)`**: Writes a sequence of characters to a file. It's a concise way to write a string to a file.
- ‚Üí **`readString(Path)`**: Reads all content from a file into a string.
- ‚Üí These methods make basic file operations much more straightforward.
```java
Path filePath = Path.of("myFile.txt");

// Write a string to a file
Files.writeString(filePath, "Hello, Java 11!");

// Read the entire file back into a string
String content = Files.readString(filePath);
```
