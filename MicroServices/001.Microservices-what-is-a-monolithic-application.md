✨ **What is a Monolithic Application**
- → A monolithic application is where different modules of a software are combined into a single application or codebase.
- → **Example:** A hospital management software with patient registration, clinical, bed management, and claim management modules all in one codebase.
- → Over time, as the codebase grows, it becomes very difficult to fix defects or add new features.
- → Fixing a bug in one module requires ensuring no other modules are impacted.
- → To add a new feature or fix a bug, the entire application must be brought down for build and deployment, affecting all modules.
