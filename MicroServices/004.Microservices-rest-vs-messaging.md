✨ **REST vs Messaging**
- → **REST (Representational State Transfer):**
    - → Usually good for synchronous request-response scenarios.
    - → Uses HTTP protocol, which is easy to implement for request-response.
    - → Ideal for developing external-facing APIs exposed outside the organization.
- → **Messaging:**
    - → Can be used for asynchronous communication.
    - → Suitable for non-blocking type applications.
    - → Much more reliable because messages can be persisted or stored and will not be lost.
    - → Usually used for applications within the organization or for microservices that communicate internally.
