✨ **Why Microservices**
- → **Heterogeneity:** Different microservice applications can be built in different programming languages and deployed to different operating systems, unlike monolithic applications.
- → **Communication:** Microservices can communicate with each other using RESTful APIs, messaging, etc.
- → **Robustness:** Even if one microservice goes down, other microservices continue to deliver their functionality.
- → **Statelessness:** Microservice applications typically do not maintain state, enabling easy scalability.
- → **Scalability:** When the load increases, different instances of the same microservice can be deployed to handle the load.
- → **Easy Deployment:** Changes or new features can be easily deployed to production because only the specific microservice needs to be dealt with, increasing time to production.
- → **Reusable and Replaceable:** The same microservice can be reused wherever required, and due to loose coupling, one microservice can be easily replaced with another if needed.
