✨ **What are Microservices**
- → Microservices are small and focused applications that bring together pieces that change for the same reason.
- → **Example:** A monolithic hospital management software can be split into four microservices: patient registration, clinical, bed management, and claim management.
- → Code boundaries are defined by business problems these microservices solve.
- → They have tiny codebases for the specific problem they are solving.
- → They are autonomous, meaning they can be built and deployed independently without impacting other microservices.
- → If they need to communicate, they do so using network calls through APIs exposed by other microservices.
- → An application is a microservice if it can be changed and deployed without changing or impacting another service.
