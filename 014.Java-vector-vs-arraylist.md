⚖️ **Vector vs. ArrayList & Hashtable vs. HashMap**

- → **Legacy Collections**
  - → `Vector` and `Hashtable` are older, legacy classes from early Java versions.

- → **Synchronization**
  - → `Vector` & `Hashtable`: **Synchronized**. All of their public methods are marked `synchronized`. This means they are thread-safe out of the box.
  - → `ArrayList` & `HashMap`: **Not synchronized**. They are not thread-safe by default.

- → **Performance**
  - → The built-in synchronization of `Vector` and `Hashtable` introduces a performance overhead. If one thread is accessing a method, other threads must wait, which can slow down the application.
  - → `ArrayList` and `HashMap` offer better performance in single-threaded environments or when synchronization is handled externally.

- → **Modern Usage**
  - → For thread-safe operations, it's generally preferred to use `Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>())` or use concurrent collections like `CopyOnWriteArrayList` and `ConcurrentHashMap` instead of `Vector` and `Hashtable`.
