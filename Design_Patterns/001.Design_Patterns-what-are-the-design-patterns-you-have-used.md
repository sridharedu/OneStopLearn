✨ **Design Patterns Used**
- → **Data Access Object (DAO) Pattern:** Used to implement the data access layer, encapsulating data access logic in a simple class.
- → **Singleton Pattern:** Implemented for utility classes where only one instance of a particular class should be created.
- → **Prototype Pattern:** Used indirectly or directly, especially when using frameworks like Spring that allow configuring singleton or prototype beans.
- → **Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC) Patterns:** Utilized when working with Spring for dependency injection across layers.
- → **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern:** Applied for the web layer, particularly with Spring Web.
- → **Factory Pattern:** Used with utility classes and factories to create instances of those classes.
- → Other patterns like Facade, Builder, Command can also be mentioned if used.
