✨ **Singleton Best Practices**
- → Make the constructor of the class private to prevent direct object creation.
- → Define a static field of the same class type globally.
- → Implement a static method to create an instance and assign it to the global static field, then return it.
- → Create the instance within a static block and acquire a class-level lock to ensure thread safety during instance creation.
- → Prevent cloning by implementing the `Cloneable` interface and overriding the `clone()` method to throw an exception (e.g., `CloneNotSupportedException`).
- → Prevent serialization and deserialization from creating new instances by implementing the `readResolve()` method to return the existing singleton instance.
