✨ **What are EC2 Spot Instances**
- → EC2 Spot Instances allow users to bid for unused EC2 capacity, offering significant cost savings (up to 90% compared to On-Demand instances).
- → **Key Characteristic:** AWS can reclaim a Spot Instance with a two-minute notice if the capacity is needed elsewhere or if the Spot price exceeds the user's bid.
- → **Use Case:** Suitable for fault-tolerant, flexible applications, or for quick, non-critical tasks where interruptions are acceptable.
