✨ **How to Create a Custom User (IAM)**
- → **Step 1: Go to IAM Service:** Navigate to the Identity and Access Management (IAM) service in AWS.
- → **Step 2: Create New User:**
    - → Create a new user (e.g., `dev_user`).
    - → Grant console access.
    - → Set a password (auto-generated or custom).
- → **Step 3: Assign Permissions:**
    - → Go to the permissions section.
    - → Attach existing policies or create custom policies.
    - → **Example:** Attach `EC2FullAccess` and `S3FullAccess` policies.
- → **Step 4: Share Credentials:** Share the user ID and password with the developer.
- → The developer will then be able to log in and access only the EC2 and S3 services based on the assigned policies.
