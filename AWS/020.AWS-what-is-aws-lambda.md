✨ **What is AWS Lambda**
- → AWS Lambda is a compute service within the AWS serverless platform.
- → It allows writing code that runs in response to events happening within other serverless components (e.g., S3, SNS, DynamoDB, SQS).
- → Similar to Java's `main` method, AWS Lambda functions have a `handler` method.
- → This `handler` method is invoked by the Lambda service when an event occurs.
- → AWS Lambda can interact with other serverless components to perform its work.
