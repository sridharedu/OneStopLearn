✨ **How to Send Notifications (e.g., for CPU Usage)**
- → To send an email notification when an instance's CPU usage or disk space is high, use AWS SNS and CloudWatch.
- → **Step 1: Create SNS Topic and Subscription:**
    - → Create an SNS topic.
    - → Create an email subscription to this topic, specifying the recipient's email address.
- → **Step 2: Create CloudWatch Alarm:**
    - → Create a CloudWatch alarm.
    - → Define the metric to monitor (e.g., CPU utilization, disk space usage).
    - → Set the threshold (e.g., if CPU usage goes above a certain percentage).
    - → Configure the alarm to publish a message to the SNS topic when the threshold is breached.
- → When the metric breaches the threshold, the CloudWatch alarm will publish a message to the SNS topic, which will then send an email notification to the subscribed email address.
