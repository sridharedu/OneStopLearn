✨ **S3 vs EBS vs EFS**
- → **S3 (Simple Storage Service):**
    - → Object-based storage service.
    - → Data is stored in `buckets` as objects.
    - → Good for storing artifacts (JARs, WARs), application log files, backups, static website content.
    - → Not suitable for operating systems or software that requires block-level access.
- → **EBS (Elastic Block Storage):**
    - → Block-level storage service.
    - → Allows reading and writing blocks of data.
    - → Can be mounted to a single EC2 instance within a region.
    - → Suitable for operating systems, databases, and applications that require persistent, low-latency block storage.
- → **EFS (Elastic File System):**
    - → File storage service.
    - → Can be mounted to any number of EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones within a region.
    - → Suitable for shared file systems, content management systems, and big data analytics.
    - → Good for storing operating systems and other software that needs to be accessed by multiple instances.
