✨ **How to Connect to a Linux EC2 Instance**
- → Use SSH (Secure Shell) to connect to a remote EC2 Linux instance.
- → When launching an EC2 instance, a key pair is generated:
    - → The public key is stored on AWS.
    - → The private key (`.pem` file) is downloaded to your local machine.
- → **SSH Command:**
    - → `ssh -i /path/to/your-private-key.pem ec2-user@<instance-public-ip-or-dns>`
    - → Replace `/path/to/your-private-key.pem` with the actual path to your downloaded private key.
    - → Replace `<instance-public-ip-or-dns>` with the public IP address or DNS name of your EC2 instance.
