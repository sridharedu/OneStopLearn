✨ **What Does it Mean to Go Serverless**
- → Serverless computing involves using cloud components to solve business problems without worrying about underlying infrastructure (servers).
- → **Key Benefits:**
    - → **No Server Management:** You don't provision, scale, or manage any servers.
    - → **Scalability & Reliability:** Non-functional requirements like scalability and reliability are handled automatically by the cloud provider.
    - → **Cost-Effective:** You pay only for what you use and how much you use it (pay-per-execution).
    - → **Speed to Market:** Faster development and deployment cycles.
