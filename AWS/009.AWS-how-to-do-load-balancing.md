✨ **How to Do Load Balancing**
- → Load balancing across EC2 instances is achieved using AWS `Load Balancer` service.
- → **Steps:**
    - → Create a Load Balancer instance.
    - → Choose the type of Load Balancer: Application Load Balancer (ALB), Network Load Balancer (NLB), Gateway Load Balancer (GLB), or Classic Load Balancer (CLB).
    - → Select the EC2 instances across which the load needs to be balanced.
    - → Configure listener rules: specify on which ports the load balancer should listen (e.g., port 80) and to which ports on the instances it should redirect traffic (e.g., port 9091).
- → The Load Balancer automatically distributes incoming traffic across the registered instances.
