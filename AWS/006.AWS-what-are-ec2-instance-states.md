✨ **EC2 Instance States**
- → **Running:** The instance is actively running.
- → **Stopped:** The instance is shut down but can be started again later. You are not charged for compute time while stopped.
- → **Rebooting:** The instance is restarting.
- → **Hibernated:** The instance is temporarily put into a low-power state, preserving its in-memory contents.
- → **Terminated:** The instance is permanently deleted. All associated data on instance store volumes is lost. You are not charged for terminated instances.
- → **Difference between Stop and Terminate:**
    - → **Stop:** Allows restarting the instance later; data on attached EBS volumes persists.
    - → **Terminate:** Permanently deletes the instance; data on attached EBS volumes is also deleted unless explicitly configured otherwise.
