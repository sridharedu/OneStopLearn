✨ **What is an AMI**
- → AMI stands for Amazon Machine Image.
- → It acts as a template to launch EC2 instances.
- → An AMI includes the necessary software, such as:
    - → Operating system.
    - → Runtimes (e.g., Java runtime, Python interpreter).
    - → Databases (e.g., MySQL).
    - → Other software (e.g., Docker).
- → Any number of instances can be launched using the same AMI if similar instances are required.
- → An AMI can also be created from an existing running instance and used to launch future instances.
