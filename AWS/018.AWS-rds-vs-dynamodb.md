✨ **RDS vs DynamoDB**
- → **RDS (Relational Database Service):**
    - → Makes it easy to work with relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, MariaDB, Amazon Aurora).
    - → Handles data replication, automatic backups, recovery, and caching features.
- → **DynamoDB:**
    - → A NoSQL database service (similar to MongoDB).
    - → Good for unstructured data, storing data as key-value pairs.
    - → AWS's version of a NoSQL database.
