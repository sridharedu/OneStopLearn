✨ **S3 Storage Classes**
- → **Standard:**
    - → Offers high durability, availability, and great performance.
    - → Choose if data is accessed frequently.
    - → Data is stored across three Availability Zones.
- → **Standard-Infrequent Access (Standard-IA):**
    - → Use if data is infrequently accessed.
    - → Provides rapid access to data when required.
- → **One Zone-Infrequent Access (One Zone-IA):**
    - → Data is stored in only one Availability Zone.
    - → Reduces cost by 20% compared to Standard-IA.
    - → Data will be lost if that Availability Zone goes down.
- → **Glacier:**
    - → Provides deep archiving for data.
    - → Data can be retrieved within a few minutes or hours.
    - → A nominal fee is charged for retrieval.
- → **S3 Intelligent-Tiering:**
    - → Pick if you cannot decide which storage class to use.
    - → Uses artificial intelligence to automatically move data between access tiers based on access patterns.
    - → A small fee is charged for this intelligence.
- → **S3 Outposts:**
    - → Allows having S3 object storage directly on your premise, close to on-premise applications.
- → **Lifecycle Policy:**
    - → You can define a lifecycle policy to automatically transition objects across these storage classes as required.
