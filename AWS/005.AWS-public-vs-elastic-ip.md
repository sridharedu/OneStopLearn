✨ **Public vs Elastic IP**
- → **Public IP Address:**
    - → Automatically allocated to an EC2 instance upon launch.
    - → Changes every time the instance is stopped and started, which can be problematic for client applications.
- → **Elastic IP Address:**
    - → A static, public IP address that does not change.
    - → Can be associated with an EC2 instance.
    - → Users are charged for Elastic IPs even when they are not associated with a running instance.
