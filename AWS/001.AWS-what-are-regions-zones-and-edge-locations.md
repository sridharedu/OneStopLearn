✨ **AWS Regions, Zones, and Edge Locations**
- → **Regions:** AWS services are spread across the world in geographical areas called regions.
- → **Availability Zones (Zones):** Regions are divided into zones, which are locations where data centers are located.
    - → Zones are interconnected to each other.
    - → Every region will have at least two zones to ensure high availability (if one zone goes down, the other backs it up).
- → **Edge Locations:**
    - → Exist between end users/clients and the zones.
    - → They cache requests and responses to provide faster response times to end users.
    - → Instead of requests always going to the main zone, they can go to the edge location, where responses are cached and sent back quickly.
