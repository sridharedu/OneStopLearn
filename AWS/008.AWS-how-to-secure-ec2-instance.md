✨ **How to Secure EC2 Instance**
- → EC2 instances are secured using `Security Groups`.
- → A Security Group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance, controlling inbound and outbound traffic.
- → **Configuring Security Group:**
    - → Navigate to the Security tab of the EC2 instance.
    - → Edit `inbound rules` to define what kind of traffic can enter the EC2 instance.
    - → **Adding a Rule:**
        - → Click "Add Rule".
        - → Select the protocol to be allowed (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP).
        - → Specify the port range for the protocol.
        - → Define the IP addresses or ranges that are allowed to access the instance through that protocol (e.g., `Anywhere` for public access, or custom IP ranges).
