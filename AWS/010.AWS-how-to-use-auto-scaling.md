✨ **How to Use Auto Scaling**
- → Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) are used to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on demand.
- → **Two-step process:**
    - → **Step 1: Create a Launch Configuration:**
        - → This defines the configuration for new instances (e.g., AMI type, instance type, security groups).
        - → It's similar to launching a single EC2 instance.
    - → **Step 2: Create an Auto Scaling Group (ASG):**
        - → Use the created launch configuration.
        - → Define a `scaling policy` within the ASG.
        - → **Scaling Policy:** Specifies rules for scaling up and down based on metrics.
            - → **Scale-up rules:** (e.g., if CPU usage is 60-70%, launch a new instance; if disk space is 80%, launch a new instance).
            - → **Scale-down rules:** (e.g., if CPU usage goes below 50%, terminate an instance).
            - → Metrics can include CPU usage, disk usage, network usage, etc.
- → This ensures instances are automatically launched when load is high and terminated when load is low.
