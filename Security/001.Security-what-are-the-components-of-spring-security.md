✨ **Components of Spring Security**
- → When a request comes from a web browser or RESTful client to a secure Spring Boot application, the first component that intercepts it is the `Authentication Filter`.
- → **Authentication Filter:**
    - → A servlet filter that checks if the request is already authenticated.
    - → If not authenticated, it forwards the request to the `Authentication Manager`.
    - → If authentication is successful, it uses `AuthenticationSuccessHandler` to store user and authentication details in a `SecurityContext` object.
    - → If authentication fails, it uses `AuthenticationFailureHandler` to send an error response back to the client.
- → **Authentication Manager:**
    - → Internally uses an `Authentication Provider`.
- → **Authentication Provider:**
    - → Contains the core authentication logic.
    - → Uses `UserDetailsService` to fetch user details from a database, LDAP, or other sources.
    - → Uses `PasswordEncoder` to encode incoming passwords (as plain text passwords are not used).
    - → If authentication is successful, it sends the appropriate response back.
    - → If authentication fails, it hands the response back to the `Authentication Manager`.
