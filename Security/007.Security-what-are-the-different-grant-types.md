✨ **Different OAuth Grant Types**
- → There are four different grant types:
    - → **Authorization Code:**
        - → The client application redirects the end user (resource owner) to the authorization server for authentication.
        - → After successful authentication, the authorization server informs the client app.
        - → The client app then requests and receives a token, which it uses to communicate with the resource server.
    - → **Password:**
        - → The client app directly takes the username and password from the resource owner.
        - → It uses these credentials to communicate with the authorization server to get a token.
        - → The token is then used to communicate with the resource server.
    - → **Client Credentials:**
        - → This workflow does not involve an end user or resource owner.
        - → Typically used for communication between microservice applications.
        - → The client app has a user ID and password provided by the authorization server, stored locally.
        - → It uses these credentials to obtain a token when needed to communicate with the resource server.
        - → Very useful for single sign-on (SSO) applications.
    - → **Refresh Token:**
        - → OAuth tokens expire after some time.
        - → If configured, the client app can use an old (expired) token to get a new token from the authorization server without going through the entire initial workflow of other grant types.
