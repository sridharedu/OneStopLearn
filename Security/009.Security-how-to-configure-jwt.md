✨ **How to Configure JWT**
- → **Step 1: Authorization Server Configuration**
    - → In the authorization server project, use `JwtAccessTokenConverter` to create JWT tokens instead of regular OAuth tokens.
    - → Store these tokens using `JwtTokenStore`.
- → **Step 2: Token Signing Methods**
    - → **Symmetric Key Signing:**
        - → Use a private/symmetric key.
        - → This key is shared with both the authorization server and the resource server.
        - → The authorization server signs the token using this key.
        - → The resource server uses the same key to symmetrically validate the token's signature.
    - → **Asymmetric Key Signing:**
        - → Generate a key pair (private key and public key) using `Java keytool`.
        - → The private key is used by the authorization server to sign the token (stored in a `.jks` file).
        - → The `.jks` file (containing both private and public keys) is shared with the resource server.
        - → The resource server uses the public key (from the `.jks` file) to verify the token's signature.
