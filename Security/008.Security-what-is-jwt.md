✨ **What is JWT**
- → JWT stands for JSON Web Token.
- → In a typical OAuth workflow, when a client application sends an OAuth token to the resource server, the resource server usually communicates with the authorization server to validate the token and get user/role information.
- → JWTs are designed to carry user and user role details directly within the token itself.
- → When a JWT token arrives at the resource server, it does not need to communicate with the authorization server to get user details, as the token already contains them.
- → JWT tokens are signed by the authorization server.
- → The resource server can verify the signature of the JWT using public/private keys, eliminating the need for another call to the authorization server for validation.
- → If the signature is valid, the token is considered valid.
