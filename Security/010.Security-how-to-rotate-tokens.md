✨ **How to Rotate Tokens**
- → Token rotation frequency depends on the use case.
- → For read/write applications (e.g., financial/banking), tokens are rotated every 5-10 minutes.
- → For read-only operations (e.g., LinkedIn feed), tokens can be rotated less frequently, such as once every six months or once a year.
