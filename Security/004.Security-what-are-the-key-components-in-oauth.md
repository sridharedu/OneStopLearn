✨ **Key Components in OAuth**
- → There are four components in the OAuth workflow:
    - → **Authorization Server:** Authenticates users and generates tokens.
    - → **Resource Server:** Stores secure resources and where applications live.
    - → **Resource Owner:** The user who owns the resource and grants permissions.
    - → **Client:** The application that needs access to resources on the Resource Server.
