✨ **What is CSRF**
- → CSRF stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery.
- → Occurs when a malicious website tricks a user's browser into sending a forged request to another trusted website where the user is authenticated.
- → The malicious site can steal cookies set by the trusted website and use them to forge a session, sending requests and potentially stealing user data.
