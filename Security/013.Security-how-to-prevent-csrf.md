✨ **How to Prevent CSRF**
- → When using Spring Security for web applications, CSRF is automatically prevented.
- → Spring Security includes a `CSRF filter` that generates a token and includes it in every web page sent back to the client.
- → When the client submits a form or request, the CSRF token must be sent back to the server.
- → If the token is missing or invalid, the CSRF filter rejects the request.
- → This prevents malicious websites from forging requests, as they will not have the valid CSRF token generated by the legitimate application.
