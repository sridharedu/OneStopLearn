✨ **OAuth Workflow**
- → A typical workflow starts when a user tries to access a client application that needs access to other resources owned by the user.
- → The client application asks the user (resource owner) to share their user ID and password with the `Authorization Server`.
- → The `Authorization Server` validates the user data and password, then generates and sends a token back to the `Client Application`.
- → The `Client Application` uses this token to communicate with the `Resource Server`.
- → The `Resource Server` validates the token by communicating with the `Authorization Server`.
- → If the token is valid, the `Resource Server` sends the required data to the `Client Application`.
