✨ **What is CORS**
- → CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- → It addresses issues that arise when a frontend application (running on one domain/port) tries to communicate with a RESTful API backend (running on a different domain/port).
- → Without CORS configuration, cross-origin request errors will occur.
- → Spring allows configuring CORS using annotations like `@CrossOrigin`.
- → CORS allows configuring security at the origin level, specifying allowed HTTP methods, and allowed HTTP headers.
- → Using `@CrossOrigin` annotation, you can specify:
    - → Which frontend application (running on which domain) can communicate with the backend (the origin).
    - → Which HTTP methods (e.g., GET, PUT, POST) are allowed from this CORS origin.
    - → What HTTP headers can be included when a CORS origin request comes in.
