ðŸ”’ **Thread Synchronization**

- â†’ **Problem:** When multiple threads access shared data, they can interfere with each other, leading to data corruption.
- â†’ **Solution:** Use the `synchronized` keyword to ensure that only one thread can execute a particular block of code at a time.

- â†’ **Synchronized Methods**
  - â†’ When a thread enters a method marked `synchronized`, it acquires an intrinsic lock on that object.
  - â†’ No other thread can enter *any* `synchronized` method on the *same object* until the first thread exits the method and releases the lock.

- â†’ **Other Uses**
  - â†’ `synchronized` can also be applied to `static` methods and as a statement block (`synchronized(this) { ... }`).
