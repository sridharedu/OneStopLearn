✨ **Different Service Types in Kubernetes**
- → **ClusterIP:**
    - → Allows pods within a cluster to communicate with each other.
    - → Creates virtual IP addresses for pods using IP tables/IPVS, mapping them to actual pod IP addresses.
    - → Also performs load balancing across pods if they host the same containers.
- → **NodePort:**
    - → Built on top of ClusterIP.
    - → Exposes a higher-order port on each node, allowing applications outside the cluster to communicate with applications running within the cluster.
- → **LoadBalancer:**
    - → Used when configuring an external load balancer (e.g., AWS Load Balancer, Azure Load Balancer).
    - → These external load balancers can balance the load across nodes within a Kubernetes cluster.
- → **ExternalName:**
    - → Used to configure and use an external application (outside the cluster) as if it were inside the cluster.
- → **Ingress (Not a Service Type, but related):**
    - → Used to expose multiple services within the cluster through a single entry point.
    - → Allows using lower port numbers (or actual service port numbers) instead of the higher NodePort numbers.
