✨ **What is Kubernetes**
- → Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool.
- → It takes containerized applications and quickly creates and maintains a cluster out of them.
- → These clusters can be used for development, testing, and production environments.
- → Can be set up as part of a CI/CD pipeline.
- → Kubernetes clusters can be deployed on organization servers or on the cloud.
- → Maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
- → Popular cloud environments (Google Cloud, AWS, Azure) have built-in support for Kubernetes, and custom clusters can also be set up on these platforms.
