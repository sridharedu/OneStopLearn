✨ **Kubernetes Architecture**
- → Kubernetes clusters consist of `nodes`.
- → **Master Nodes:**
    - → **API Server:** The key component that allows the master node to manage the entire cluster. Communication with the API server is done via tools like `kubectl`.
    - → **Scheduler:** Schedules the required pods on the worker nodes.
    - → **Control Manager:** Runs in the background, ensuring the cluster always remains in its desired state (e.g., if a pod goes down, the control manager ensures another comes up).
    - → **etcd:** A distributed key-value store that stores the current state of the cluster. This allows other master nodes to take over if one goes down.
- → **Worker Nodes:**
    - → **Kubelet:** The main component on the worker node, responsible for creating pods and containers inside them. The API server communicates with Kubelet to get work done.
    - → **Kube-proxy:** A network proxy and load balancer present on every worker node. It handles network communication for applications outside the cluster to communicate with containers inside pods, and can also perform load balancing.
