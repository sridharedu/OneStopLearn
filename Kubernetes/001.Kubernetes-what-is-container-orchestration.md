✨ **What is Container Orchestration**
- → Container orchestration is the process of managing a cluster of containers while providing various non-functional requirements or services.
- → **Fault Tolerance:** If one container goes down, there should be other containers to back it up.
- → **On-Demand Scaling:**
    - → If the load on a microservice container increases, scaling should happen automatically (more containers created).
    - → When the load decreases, containers should be scaled down to conserve resources.
- → **Auto Discovery:** Microservice applications running on different containers should be able to automatically discover and use each other.
- → **Public Access:** Containers within the cluster need to be accessible by other containers within the cluster, as well as from outside the cluster.
- → **Auto Update and Rollback:**
    - → **Auto Update:** Deploy applications without affecting clients; old containers remain up while new ones come online, then old ones die out.
    - → **Rollback:** Ability to revert to a previous stable cluster state if issues arise with a new deployment.
