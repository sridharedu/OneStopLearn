✨ **What is a Deployment**
- → A Kubernetes Deployment is how pods and ReplicaSets are managed as a single unit.
- → It defines the pods in the `template` section (including volumes and other pod requirements).
- → It also specifies the number of replicas (desired number of pods) in the `replicas` field.
- → All these configurations are managed within a `deployment.yaml` file.
