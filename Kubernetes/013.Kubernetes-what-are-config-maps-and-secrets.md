✨ **What are Config Maps and Secrets**
- → **Config Maps:**
    - → Used to pass configuration information (non-sensitive data) into a Kubernetes cluster.
    - → Define data as key-value pairs.
    - → Can be bound and used within a deployment, similar to how volumes are bound.
- → **Secrets:**
    - → Used for sensitive details like usernames and passwords.
    - → Stored in a temporary location.
    - → Only brought onto the pod when the secret information is required.
    - → Deleted from the pod location as soon as the data is used, but they persist in the temporary location.
