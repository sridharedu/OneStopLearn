✨ **Volumes vs Persistent Volumes (PV)**
- → **Volumes:**
    - → Their lifecycle is tied to the pod or node.
    - → If a node dies, the volume is gone.
- → **Persistent Volumes (PV):**
    - → Their lifecycle lasts beyond the scope of a pod or node.
    - → Even if the node dies, the persistent volume will still live.
