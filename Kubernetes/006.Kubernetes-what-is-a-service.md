✨ **What is a Service**
- → A Kubernetes Service object logically groups a set of pods that need to communicate with each other and with the outside world.
- → Created using a `service.yaml` file, where the type of service and exposed ports are specified.
- → Services are bound to a particular deployment (which contains the pods) through `labels` and `selectors`.
- → Labels and selectors are used to map a service to a group of pods within a deployment.
