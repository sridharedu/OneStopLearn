✨ **What are Namespaces**
- → Kubernetes Namespaces are used to logically divide a cluster when multiple applications are deployed.
- → They prevent applications from interfering with each other and ensure fair resource allocation.
- → Once a namespace is created and assigned to a project or team, all applications for that project/team should be confined to that namespace.
- → Applications within a namespace can only use the CPU, processes, and other resources allocated to that specific namespace.
