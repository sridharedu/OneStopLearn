↔️ **ArrayList vs. LinkedList**

- → **Internal Structure**
  - → `ArrayList`: Backed by a dynamic array.
  - → `LinkedList`: Implemented as a doubly-linked list with nodes pointing to `previous` and `next` elements.

- → **Insertion/Deletion**
  - → `ArrayList`: Can be slow (O(n)) for random insertions/deletions because it may require shifting elements in the underlying array.
  - → `LinkedList`: Fast (O(1)) for insertions/deletions once the position is known, as it only involves updating node pointers.

- → **Random Access**
  - → `ArrayList`: Very fast (O(1)) for random access using an index (`get(index)`).
  - → `LinkedList`: Slow (O(n)) for random access as it requires traversing the list from the beginning or end to find the element.

- → **Use Case**
  - → `ArrayList`: Best for read-intensive applications where you have few insertions or deletions.
  - → `LinkedList`: Best for write-intensive applications with frequent insertions and deletions.
