✨ **Different Maven Dependency Scopes**
- → **compile:**
    - → Dependency is required during compilation of source code and test code.
    - → Will be bundled if creating a WAR or EAR file.
- → **test:**
    - → Dependency is required only for the compilation and execution of tests.
- → **provided:**
    - → Dependency is required for compilation and testing.
    - → Should *not* be included in the bundled WAR or EAR file.
    - → It is expected to be provided by the application server, web container, or environment where the application is deployed.
- → **import:**
    - → Makes sense only in the `pom.xml` of parent projects with packaging type `pom`.
    - → Usually used in combination with the `dependencyManagement` section to import dependencies from another POM.
