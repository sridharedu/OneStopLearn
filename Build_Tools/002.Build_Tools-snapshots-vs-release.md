✨ **Maven Snapshot vs Release Versions**
- → **Snapshot Version (e.g., `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`):**
    - → Indicates that the project is still under active development.
    - → If another project depends on a snapshot version, it should expect new code changes frequently (e.g., daily).
    - → Every time a commit happens, even with the same version number, new changes will be added to the snapshot.
- → **Release Version (e.g., `1.0.0`):**
    - → Indicates that the project is ready for release.
    - → There will be no `-SNAPSHOT` in the version string.
    - → No more code changes are expected for this particular version.
    - → Any project that depends on a release version will get the exact same copy, regardless of how many times they pull the library.
