✨ **How to Override a Transitive Dependency Version**
- → **Transitive Dependency:** When a project defines a dependency, and that dependency itself requires another library to function, the required library is a transitive dependency, which Maven automatically pulls.
- → **Overriding Version:** Yes, you can override the version of a transitive dependency.
- → To override, explicitly define the transitive dependency in your project's `pom.xml`.
- → Specify the exact version you want to use for that dependency.
- → By default, Maven pulls the version required by the direct dependency, but explicit definition allows you to enforce a specific version.
