✨ **How to Control Dependencies in Maven**
- → **Multi-Module Project with Parent POM:**
    - → Create a multi-module project with a parent `pom.xml`.
    - → The parent `pom.xml`'s packaging type should be `pom` (not `jar` or `war`).
- → **`dependencyManagement` Section:**
    - → Define a `dependencyManagement` section in the parent `pom.xml`.
    - → List all required dependencies and their versions within this section.
- → **Child Projects:**
    - → In child projects, define the parent project in their `pom.xml`.
    - → When a child project needs a dependency, it uses the `<dependency>` block but *does not* specify the version.
    - → The version will be automatically derived from the parent's `dependencyManagement` section, ensuring consistency across all projects.
- → **Plugin Management:**
    - → Similarly, define a `pluginManagement` section in the parent `pom.xml` for plugins and their versions.
    - → Child projects simply use the plugin without specifying the version.
