✨ **What is Unit Testing**
- → Unit testing involves testing individual classes or components of an application in complete isolation.
- → In Java/Spring Boot applications, code is organized into layers (controllers, services, integration, data access).
- → Unit tests focus on testing all public methods within each class.
- → Dependencies of the class under test (e.g., a controller depending on a service, or a service depending on a repository) are mocked out.
- → The goal is to test the method's code in complete isolation, without involving its real dependencies.
