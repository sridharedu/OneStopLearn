✨ **What is Mocking**
- → **Step 1: Add Mocking Library:** Include a mocking library like Mockito to the project's classpath.
- → **Step 2: Annotate Mock Objects:** Mark objects to be mocked with the `@Mock` annotation in unit tests.
- → **Step 3: Inject Mocks:** Annotate the class under test with `@InjectMocks` so Mockito injects the mocked objects into it.
- → **Step 4: Stub Method Calls:** Within test methods, use Mockito's `when()` method to define behavior for method calls on mocked objects.
    - → When a particular method on a mock object is invoked, a predefined mocked output is returned instead of executing the actual method.
- → **Step 5: Invoke Method Under Test:** Call the method being tested on the test class.
- → **Step 6: Verify Interactions:** Use Mockito's `verify()` method to confirm that expected methods on the mocked object were called.
- → **Step 7: Assert Results:** Use JUnit assertions to verify the expected outcome of the test.
