✨ **Code Review Checklist**
- → **Functionality:** Ensure the code delivers expected functionality as per acceptance criteria/requirements.
- → **Reinvention:** Avoid reinventing the wheel; use existing project components or approved open-source libraries.
- → **Object-Oriented Principles:** Follow OOP principles like encapsulation and inheritance for code reuse.
- → **Interfaces:** Code to interfaces where appropriate.
- → **Error Handling:** Ensure null pointer exception checks are done, exceptions are handled and logged correctly, and not eaten up.
- → **Clean Coding Practices:**
    - → Use meaningful and short names for classes, methods, and variables.
    - → Functions should be short and do only one thing.
    - → Functions should not take too many parameters; wrap them in an object if necessary.
    - → Use code formatting templates across the project for consistent formatting.
- → **Non-Functional Aspects:**
    - → **Logging:** Use proper log levels; ensure enough information is logged, but not too much.
    - → **Security:** Do not log sensitive information; use immutable objects; ensure authentication, authorization, encryption, and digital signatures are used where required.
    - → **Performance:** Use the right type of collection classes; ensure thread safety (e.g., using concurrent collections instead of synchronized collections).
    - → **Memory Leaks:** Ensure static fields/variables holding object references are short-lived to avoid memory leaks.
    - → **Configuration:** Move hardcoded values to properties files and inject them.
- → **Testing:** Ensure sufficient and meaningful test coverage, including edge cases.
