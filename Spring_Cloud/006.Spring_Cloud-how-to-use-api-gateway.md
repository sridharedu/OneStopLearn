✨ **How to Use API Gateway**
- → **Step 1: Create API Gateway Project:**
    - → Create a new Spring Boot project.
    - → Add the `spring-cloud-starter-gateway` dependency.
- → **Step 2: Configure Microservice Routes:**
    - → Configure the microservice routes that should go through this API Gateway.
    - → The API Gateway acts as a client to the Eureka server to fetch the URL, port number, and other details for these microservice applications.
- → **Workflow:**
    - → All requests for these microservices will go through the API Gateway.
    - → Custom filter logic can be written within the API Gateway to address any cross-cutting concerns (e.g., security, logging, rate limiting) in a centralized manner.
