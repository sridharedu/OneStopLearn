✨ **What is Service Registration and Discovery**
- → When multiple microservice applications communicate, instead of remembering URLs and port numbers, they use a `Naming Server` component.
- → Microservices register themselves with the Naming Server by providing a unique application name/ID and their communication information (URL, port numbers).
- → The Naming Server acts as a registry of application IDs and their communication details.
- → Microservices that want to communicate with others can talk to the Naming Server using just the application ID to get the addresses and port numbers.
- → In Spring Cloud, the `Eureka Server` component acts as the Naming Server.
- → All microservice applications in Spring Cloud register themselves with Eureka Server.
- → Other microservices can dynamically discover and communicate through the Eureka Server.
