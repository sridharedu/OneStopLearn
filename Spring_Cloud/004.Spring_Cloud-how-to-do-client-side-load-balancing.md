✨ **How to Do Client-Side Load Balancing**
- → Client-side load balancing is where the distribution of load to a provider microservice is done directly on the client side.
- → In Spring Cloud, the `Load Balancer` component (formerly Ribbon) is used to accomplish this.
- → **Configuration:**
    - → Add the `spring-cloud-starter-loadbalancer` dependency to the project.
- → **Workflow:**
    - → The Load Balancer automatically looks at `application.properties` to find where the Eureka Server is running.
    - → When a RESTful call is made using a client like Feign Client (which integrates beautifully with the Load Balancer), the Load Balancer intercepts it.
    - → It fetches the details of the provider microservice's multiple running instances from the Eureka Server.
    - → It then automatically distributes the load across these instances, sending each request to a different service or provider instance.
