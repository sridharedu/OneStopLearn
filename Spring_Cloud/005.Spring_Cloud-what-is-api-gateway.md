✨ **What is API Gateway**
- → The API Gateway component in Spring Cloud centralizes cross-cutting concerns for microservice applications.
- → Instead of repeating non-functional requirements like security, logging, tracing, and rate limiting across individual microservices, they are handled in one single place: the API Gateway.
- → All microservice applications must go through this API Gateway.
- → Custom filters (pre-filter, post-filter, error filter, route filter, etc.) can be written within the API Gateway to apply custom logic during routing.
- → This allows addressing cross-cutting concerns efficiently and consistently across all microservices.
