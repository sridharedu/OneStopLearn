✨ **What is Spring Cloud**
- → Spring Cloud is a collection of open-source components that address non-functional requirements for microservice applications built with Spring Boot.
- → **Non-functional requirements addressed:**
    - → **Service Registration and Discovery:** Microservices register themselves and can dynamically discover others at runtime.
    - → **Load Balancing:** Both client-side and provider/server-side load balancing.
    - → **Fault Tolerance:** Graceful handling of failures within a microservice.
    - → **Easy Integration:** Facilitates communication among microservices.
    - → **Cross-cutting Concerns:** Handles common concerns like security, logging, etc., in a single place.
    - → **Distributed Tracing:** Traces client requests as they flow through multiple microservices to identify issues.
