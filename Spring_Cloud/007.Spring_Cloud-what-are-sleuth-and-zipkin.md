✨ **What are Sleuth and Zipkin**
- → **Sleuth:**
    - → Used for distributed tracing in Spring Cloud microservices.
    - → As microservice requests flow from one service to another, Sleuth automatically adds tracing information to logs.
    - → It adds an `application name`, `trace ID`, and other details to every log entry.
    - → This allows tracing the entire request flow from the client through all involved microservices.
    - → Helps in figuring out where exactly something went wrong and which application is responsible.
- → **Zipkin:**
    - → Compliments Sleuth by providing a beautiful UI/dashboard for distributed tracing.
    - → It visualizes the request flow and helps in analyzing where a request failed and why.
    - → Collects and aggregates trace data from Sleuth-instrumented applications, making it easy to inspect and troubleshoot distributed transactions.
