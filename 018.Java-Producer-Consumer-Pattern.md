ðŸ”„ **Producer-Consumer Pattern**

- â†’ **Recommended Collection: `BlockingQueue`**
  - â†’ The `BlockingQueue` interface is specifically designed to simplify the implementation of the producer-consumer problem.

- â†’ **Producer Thread**
  - â†’ Uses the `put(E e)` method to add elements (work) to the queue.
  - â†’ If the queue is full, the `put()` method will **block** (wait) until space becomes available.

- â†’ **Consumer Thread**
  - â†’ Uses the `take()` method to retrieve elements from the queue.
  - â†’ If the queue is empty, the `take()` method will **block** until an element is available.

- â†’ **Benefit**
  - â†’ `BlockingQueue` handles all the synchronization and waiting, making the logic for the producer and consumer very clean and straightforward.
