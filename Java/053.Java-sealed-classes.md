🛡️ **Sealed Classes and Interfaces (Preview Feature)**
- → A preview feature in Java 15 that allows you to restrict which other classes or interfaces may extend or implement them.
- → **Purpose:** Provides more fine-grained control over inheritance, enabling a class author to declare which classes are permitted to be direct subclasses.
- → **Keywords:**
  - → `sealed`: Applied to a class or interface declaration to indicate it is sealed.
  - → `permits`: Used after the `sealed` class/interface declaration to specify the exact list of classes that are allowed to extend or implement it.
- → **Rules for Permitted Subclasses:**
  - → They must be in the same module or package as the sealed class.
  - → They must explicitly extend the sealed class.
  - → They must be marked as either `final`, `sealed`, or `non-sealed`.
```java
// The interface is sealed and only permits specific implementations
public sealed interface Shape
    permits Circle, Square {
}

// Permitted subclasses must be final, sealed, or non-sealed
public final class Circle implements Shape { ... }

public non-sealed class Square implements Shape { ... }
```
