🗣️ **Inter-Thread Communication**

- → Threads communicate using the `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()` methods, which are part of the `Object` class.

- → **`wait()`**
  - → When a thread calls `wait()` on an object, it releases the lock on that object and enters a waiting state.

- → **`notify()`**
  - → A thread that holds the lock on the same object can call `notify()` to wake up a single waiting thread.

- → **`notifyAll()`**
  - → Wakes up *all* threads that are waiting on the object's lock.

- → **Requirement:** These methods **must** be called from within a `synchronized` method or block. If not, an `IllegalMonitorStateException` will be thrown.
