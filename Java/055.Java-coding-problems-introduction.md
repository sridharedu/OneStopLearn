ðŸ’¡ **Coding Problems: Approach and Best Practices**

- â†’ **Interactive Problem Solving:** Instead of directly jumping into code, explain your thought process, how you approach the problem, and how you arrive at a solution. This demonstrates communication skills and logical thinking.

- â†’ **Adhere to Conventions:**
  - â†’ Use standard naming conventions for classes, methods, and variables.
  - â†’ Ensure your code is readable and well-structured.
  - â†’ Validate input data and throw appropriate exceptions where necessary.
  - â†’ Consider non-functional requirements like security and performance.

- â†’ **Multiple Solutions:** Be prepared to discuss different approaches to solving a problem. Present your primary solution and then explain alternative methods, highlighting their trade-offs (e.g., time complexity, space complexity, readability).
