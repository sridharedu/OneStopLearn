⚖️ **Comparable vs. Comparator**

- → **`Comparable` Interface**
  - → **Purpose:** Provides a **natural** or **default** ordering for a class.
  - → **Package:** `java.lang`
  - → **Implementation:** The class whose objects you want to sort must implement this interface.
  - → **Method:** Requires implementing `int compareTo(T o)`.
  - → **Logic:** Defines the single, standard way to sort objects of that class.

- → **`Comparator` Interface**
  - → **Purpose:** Provides a **custom** or **external** ordering. You can define multiple different comparison strategies.
  - → **Package:** `java.util`
  - → **Implementation:** A separate class is created that implements this interface.
  - → **Method:** Requires implementing `int compare(T o1, T o2)`.
  - → **Logic:** Defines a specific ordering logic, independent of the class being sorted.

- → **Return Value Logic (for both)**
  - → **Negative integer:** `object1` should come before `object2`.
  - → **Zero:** `object1` and `object2` are equal.
  - → **Positive integer:** `object1` should come after `object2`.

- → **Usage in Collections (`TreeSet`, `TreeMap`)**
  - → If no `Comparator` is provided, the collection will look for the `Comparable` interface on the objects being added and use its `compareTo` method for sorting.
  - → If you pass a `Comparator` to the collection's constructor, it will use that `Comparator`'s `compare` method for sorting, overriding any natural ordering.
