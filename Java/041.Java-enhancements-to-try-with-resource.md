ðŸ“¦ **`try-with-resources` Enhancements**
- â†’ **Before Java 9:** The resource to be managed had to be declared and initialized *inside* the `try` parentheses.
```java
// Pre-Java 9
MyResource resource1 = new MyResource();
try (MyResource r = resource1) {
    // ... use r ...
}
```
- â†’ **Starting with Java 9:** The `try-with-resources` statement can manage a resource that is a final or effectively final variable, without needing to declare it inside the `try` block.
```java
// Java 9 and later
MyResource resource1 = new MyResource();
try (resource1) { // Much more concise
    // ... use resource1 ...
}
```
