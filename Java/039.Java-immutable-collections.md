🛡️ **Immutable Collections**
- → **Before Java 9:** Creating immutable collections was verbose, requiring the use of the `Collections` utility class (e.g., `Collections.unmodifiableList(myList)`).
- → **Starting with Java 9:** Convenient factory methods `of()` were added to collection interfaces like `List`, `Set`, and `Map`.
- → These methods create compact, unmodifiable collections in a single line.
- → Attempting to modify a collection created with `of()` will result in an `UnsupportedOperationException`.
```java
// Creates an immutable list
List<String> immutableList = List.of("one", "two", "three");

// Creates an immutable set
Set<Integer> immutableSet = Set.of(1, 2, 3);
```
