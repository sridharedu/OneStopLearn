ðŸ§± **Synchronized Blocks**

- â†’ **Problem:** Marking an entire method as `synchronized` can be inefficient if only a small part of the method needs protection.
- â†’ **Solution:** Use a `synchronized` block to lock only the critical section of code.
- â†’ **Syntax:** `synchronized(object) { // code to be synchronized }`
- â†’ **Benefit:** This allows for more fine-grained control over locking, improving concurrency as other threads can still execute the non-synchronized parts of the method.
- â†’ You can specify which object to lock on (e.g., `this` for the current object, or `MyClass.class` for a class-level lock).
