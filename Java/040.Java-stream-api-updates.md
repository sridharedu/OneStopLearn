- â†’ **`takeWhile(Predicate)`**: Returns a stream consisting of the initial elements that match the predicate. It stops taking elements as soon as the predicate returns `false` for the first time.
- â†’ **`dropWhile(Predicate)`**: The opposite of `takeWhile`. It discards the initial elements that match the predicate and returns a stream of the remaining elements, starting with the first one for which the predicate is `false`.
- â†’ **`ofNullable(T t)`**: Returns a stream containing a single element if the element is non-null, otherwise returns an empty stream. Useful for avoiding `NullPointerException` when creating streams from potentially null values, especially within a `flatMap` operation.
