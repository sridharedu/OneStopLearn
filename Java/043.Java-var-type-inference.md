🔍 **`var` - Local-Variable Type Inference**
- → Introduced in Java 10, `var` allows the compiler to **infer** the type of a local variable from the right-hand side of its declaration.
- → **It is NOT like JavaScript's `var`:**
  - → The type is determined at compile time and is **immutable**. You cannot assign a different type to the variable later.
  - → It is **not a keyword**. This was a deliberate choice to avoid breaking older code that might have used "var" as a variable name.

- → **Benefits:**
  - → Reduces boilerplate and improves readability, especially with complex generic types.
  - → `var list = new ArrayList<Map<String, Integer>>();` is much cleaner than repeating the type on the left.

- → **Limitations:**
  - → Can only be used for **local variables** (inside methods, loops, etc.).
  - → Cannot be used for class fields, method parameters, or return types.
  - → Cannot be used to declare a variable without an initializer (`var x;` is illegal).
  - → Cannot be used for lambda expressions directly (`var lambda = () -> ...` is illegal because the target type must be explicit).
