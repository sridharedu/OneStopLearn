ðŸ“¦ **Object Class Methods**
- â†’ Every class in Java implicitly extends the `Object` class, inheriting its methods.

ðŸ”§ **Overridable Methods**
- â†’ **`equals(Object obj)`**: Compares two objects for equality. The default implementation checks for reference equality (`==`).
- â†’ **`hashCode()`**: Returns a hash code value for the object, used in hash-based collections like `HashMap`.
- â†’ **`toString()`**: Returns a string representation of the object. The default implementation prints the class name and hash code.
- â†’ **`clone()`**: Creates and returns a copy of the object (a shallow copy by default).
- â†’ **`finalize()`**: Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection determines that there are no more references to the object.

ðŸ”’ **Non-Overridable Concurrency Methods**
- â†’ **`wait()`**: Causes the current thread to wait until another thread invokes `notify()` or `notifyAll()` for this object.
- â†’ **`notify()`**: Wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object's monitor.
- â†’ **`notifyAll()`**: Wakes up all threads that are waiting on this object's monitor.
