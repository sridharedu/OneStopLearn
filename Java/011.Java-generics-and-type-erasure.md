💎 **Generics**
- → A feature introduced in Java 5 to provide type-safety for collections and classes.
- → Allows you to specify the type of objects that a collection can hold.

📜 **Before Generics (Pre-Java 5)**
- → Collections stored objects of any type, leading to potential `ClassCastException` at runtime.
```java
// No type safety. Can add any object.
List myList = new ArrayList();
myList.add(123); // An Integer
myList.add("John"); // A String - this is allowed, but may cause errors later.
```

✅ **With Generics**
- → Type is specified using angle brackets `<>`.
- → The compiler enforces type-safety at compile time, preventing incorrect types from being added.
```java
// Specifies that this list can only hold Integers.
List<Integer> myList = new ArrayList<>();
myList.add(123); // OK
// myList.add("John"); // Compile-time error!
```

🗑️ **Type Erasure**
- → The process where the compiler removes the generic type information after compilation.
- → The bytecode produced is similar to the pre-generics code (using `Object`).
- → **Why?** For backward compatibility. It ensures that code written before Java 5 can still run on newer JVMs.
- → This means generics in Java are a **compile-time** feature, not a runtime one.
