ðŸ§± **Record Enhancements (Java 15)**
- â†’ The `record` type, still a preview feature in Java 15, received several enhancements.
- â†’ **Sealed Records:** Records can now implement `sealed` interfaces. This allows you to use the conciseness of records within a restricted inheritance hierarchy.
- â†’ **Local Records:** You can now declare records inside methods or inner classes.
- â†’ **Annotations on Record Components:** It is now possible to apply annotations to the components of a record, which is useful for validation, serialization, etc.
```java
// A sealed interface
sealed interface Shape permits Circle, Rectangle {}

// An annotation for validation
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.RECORD_COMPONENT)
@interface Positive {}

// A record implementing the sealed interface and using an annotation
public record Circle(@Positive double radius) implements Shape {}

// A record can also be declared locally inside a method
public void someMethod() {
    record Point(int x, int y) {}
    Point p = new Point(10, 20);
}
```
