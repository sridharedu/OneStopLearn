ðŸ§µ **Creating Threads**

- â†’ **1. Extend the `Thread` Class**
  - â†’ Create a class that `extends` `java.lang.Thread`.
  - â†’ Override the `run()` method and place the thread's execution logic inside it.
  - â†’ **Limitation:** Since Java does not support multiple inheritance, your class cannot extend any other class.
  - â†’ **Usage:** Create an instance of your class and call its `start()` method.

- â†’ **2. Implement the `Runnable` Interface**
  - â†’ Create a class that `implements` `java.lang.Runnable`.
  - â†’ Provide the implementation for the `run()` method.
  - â†’ **Advantage:** This is the preferred approach as it allows your class to extend another class if needed.
  - â†’ **Usage:** 
    - â†’ Create an instance of your runnable class.
    - â†’ Create an instance of the `Thread` class, passing your runnable object to its constructor.
    - â†’ Call the `start()` method on the `Thread` object.
