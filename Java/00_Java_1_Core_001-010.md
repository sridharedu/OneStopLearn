## 001.Java-components.md

🧰 **JDK (Java Development Kit)**  
- → First thing to install for Java development  
- → Includes: `javac` (🛠 compiler), `java` (🚀 launcher), 📦 JRE, and other tools  
- → OS-specific builds available (Windows/Linux/Mac)  
- → Needed for both compiling and running Java apps  

🔁 **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**  
- → Subset of JDK  
- → Includes: JVM and runtime libraries  
- → ⚙️ Used for running only (not compiling)  
- → 📦 Usually bundled with JDK  

🧠 **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**  
- → 🚀 Launched using `java ClassName`  
- → Reads `.class` (bytecode) → converts to machine code  
- → 🌍 Enables platform independence: compile on Windows, run on Linux  
- → JVM is OS-specific, but bytecode is portable  

🛠 **javac (Java Compiler)**  
- → Converts `.java` → `.class`  
- → 📦 Output is bytecode (not native machine code)  
- → 🌐 Portable across platforms  

🚀 **java (Java Command)**  
- → Used to run `.class` files  
- → Launches JVM → interprets or JIT-compiles the bytecode  

📦 **Bytecode**  
- → Output of compilation  
- → Stored in `.class` files  
- → Platform-independent, readable only by JVM  

⚡ **JIT Compiler (Just-In-Time)**  
- → Built into JVM  
- → Converts bytecode → machine code at runtime  
- → 📈 Improves performance using inlining, caching, etc.  
- → ✅ Enabled by default  

🚫 **Disabling JIT (for debugging)**  
- → 🔧 Use `-Djava.compiler=NONE` with the `java` command  
- → 🐢 JVM runs in interpreter-only mode (no JIT optimization)  

📌 **Execution Flow**  
- → 1️⃣ Write `.java`  
- → 2️⃣ Compile using `javac` → generates `.class`  
- → 3️⃣ Run using `java` → starts JVM  
- → 4️⃣ JVM loads `.class` → JIT compiles → executes on OS

## 002.Java-constructors.md
🧱 **Constructors**
- → A special method to initialize an object's properties upon creation.
- → Must have the same name as the class it is in.
- → Invoked only once when an object instance is created.

↔️ **Constructors vs. Methods**
- → **Name:** Constructor name must match the class name; method names can be different.
- → **Invocation:** Constructors are called automatically at object creation; methods must be called explicitly.
- → **Frequency:** A constructor runs once per object; methods can be called any number of times.

🔄 **Constructor Chaining (Same Class)**
- → Use `this()` to call another constructor within the same class.
- → `this()` must be the very first statement inside the calling constructor.
```java
class Accord {
    Accord() {
        this("V6"); // Calls the parameterized constructor
        System.out.println("Default constructor called.");
    }

    Accord(String engine) {
        System.out.println("Engine type: " + engine);
    }
}
```

🔼 **Invoking Superclass Constructor**
- → Use `super()` to call the constructor of the parent (superclass).
- → `super()` must be the very first statement in the child class's constructor.
```java
class Honda {
    Honda() {
        System.out.println("Honda constructor called.");
    }
}

class Accord extends Honda {
    Accord() {
        super(); // Calls the Honda() constructor
        System.out.println("Accord constructor called.");
    }
}
```
## 003.Java-abstract-vs-interface.md
🎨 **Abstract Class**
- → A class that must be declared `abstract` if it includes at least one abstract method.
- → If a class extends an abstract class, it must implement all its abstract methods or be declared abstract itself.
- → Can contain a mix of methods with and without implementation.
```java
abstract class Shape {
    // Concrete method
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a shape.");
    }
    // Abstract method
    abstract double getArea();
}
```

 blueprint **Interface**
- → A contract where all methods are implicitly `public` and `abstract`.
- → The class that `implements` the interface must provide implementations for all its methods.
```java
interface Rotatable {
    void rotate(); // public abstract by default
}
```

⚖️ **Key Differences**
- → **Inheritance:** A class can `extend` only one abstract class.
- → **Implementation:** A class can `implement` multiple interfaces.
- → **Methods:** Abstract classes can have implemented methods; interfaces traditionally cannot (before Java 8 `default` methods).
## 004.Java-multiple-inheritance.md
💎 **Multiple Inheritance**
- → Java does not support extending more than one class (multiple inheritance) to avoid ambiguity.

🤔 **The Ambiguity Problem**
- → If a class inherits from two parent classes that have methods with the same name and signature, the compiler doesn't know which one to use.
- → This is often called the "Deadly Diamond of Death" or "Diamond Problem."
- → Attempting to do this will result in a compile-time error.

```java
class Father {
    void money() {
        System.out.println("Father's money.");
    }
}

class Mother {
    void money() {
        System.out.println("Mother's money.");
    }
}

// This is not allowed in Java and will cause a compile error.
class ConfusedKid extends Father, Mother {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConfusedKid kid = new ConfusedKid();
        kid.money(); // Which one to call? Father's or Mother's?
    }
}
```

💍 **The Diamond Problem**
- → A more complex version of the ambiguity problem.
- → It occurs when a class `D` inherits from two classes `B` and `C`, and both `B` and `C` inherit from a single class `A`.
- → If `A` has a method that `B` and `C` override, `D` has an ambiguous choice of which overridden method to inherit.
## 005.Java-interfaces-same-method.md
🤝 **Implementing Interfaces with Same Method**
- → A class can implement two or more interfaces that have methods with the exact same signature.
- → This does not cause the "Diamond Problem" seen with multiple inheritance of classes.
- → The implementing class simply provides a single implementation for the shared method, which satisfies the contract for all interfaces.

```java
interface Car {
    void go();
    void stop();
}

interface Driverless {
    void sitDownAndRelax();
    void go(); // Same method signature as in Car
}

class Honda implements Car, Driverless {
    // A single implementation for the go() method satisfies both interfaces.
    @Override
    public void go() {
        System.out.println("Honda is going.");
    }

    @Override
    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Honda has stopped.");
    }

    @Override
    public void sitDownAndRelax() {
        System.out.println("Sit back and relax, the car is driving itself.");
    }
}
```
## 006.Java-object-class-methods.md
📦 **Object Class Methods**
- → Every class in Java implicitly extends the `Object` class, inheriting its methods.

🔧 **Overridable Methods**
- → **`equals(Object obj)`**: Compares two objects for equality. The default implementation checks for reference equality (`==`).
- → **`hashCode()`**: Returns a hash code value for the object, used in hash-based collections like `HashMap`.
- → **`toString()`**: Returns a string representation of the object. The default implementation prints the class name and hash code.
- → **`clone()`**: Creates and returns a copy of the object (a shallow copy by default).
- → **`finalize()`**: Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection determines that there are no more references to the object.

🔒 **Non-Overridable Concurrency Methods**
- → **`wait()`**: Causes the current thread to wait until another thread invokes `notify()` or `notifyAll()` for this object.
- → **`notify()`**: Wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object's monitor.
- → **`notifyAll()`**: Wakes up all threads that are waiting on this object's monitor.
## 007.Java-default-hashCode-implementation.md
🔢 **Default hashCode() Implementation**
- → If a class does not override the `hashCode()` method, it uses the default implementation from the `Object` class.
- → This default implementation returns an integer that typically represents the object's memory address.
- → Therefore, if you don't provide a custom `hashCode()` method, the value returned will be based on the memory location of that specific object.
## 008.Java-default-toString-implementation.md
📜 **Default toString() Implementation**
- → When you print an object of a class that hasn't overridden `toString()`, the default implementation from the `Object` class is used.
- → This default method returns a string with the following format: `ClassName@HexadecimalHashCode`.
- → The part after the `@` symbol is the hexadecimal representation of the object's hash code, which is typically derived from its memory address.
- → If you override `toString()`, the custom implementation you provide will be used instead.
## 009.Java-equals-vs-double-equals.md
⚖️ **`equals()` Method vs. `==` Operator**
- → A common source of confusion when comparing objects in Java.

👬 **`==` Operator (Reference Comparison)**
- → Compares the memory addresses (references) of two objects.
- → Returns `true` only if both references point to the exact same object in memory.
- → It performs a "shallow comparison."
```java
User u1 = new User(1, "John");
User u2 = new User(1, "John");
// Returns false because u1 and u2 are different objects in memory.
boolean result = (u1 == u2);
```

🤝 **`equals()` Method (Content Comparison)**
- → **Default Behavior:** The default `equals()` method from the `Object` class behaves exactly like the `==` operator, comparing memory references.
```java
// By default, this also returns false.
boolean result = u1.equals(u2);
```
- → **Overridden Behavior:** To compare the actual content of objects (a "deep comparison"), you must override the `equals()` method in your class.
```java
class User {
    // ... fields and constructor ...
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj) return true;
        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;
        User user = (User) obj;
        return id == user.id && name.equals(user.name);
    }
}
// Now, u1.equals(u2) will return true.
```

✨ **Special Cases: String, Wrappers, Enums**
- → For `String`, wrapper types (`Integer`, `Double`, etc.), and `Enums`, the `equals()` method is already overridden to perform a deep content comparison.
```java
String s1 = new String("abc");
String s2 = new String("abc");

// false: s1 and s2 are different objects.
s1 == s2;

// true: The content is the same.
s1.equals(s2);
```

📌 **Summary**
- → Use `==` to check if two references point to the same object.
- → Use `equals()` to check if two objects are meaningfully equivalent.
- → Always override `equals()` (and `hashCode()`) in your own classes for proper content comparison.
## 010.Java-final-finally-finalize.md
🔑 **`final` Keyword**
- → A modifier that can be applied to variables, methods, and classes.
- → **Variables:** Makes the variable a constant. Its value cannot be changed once assigned.
- → **Object References:** The reference variable cannot be reassigned to a new object, but the state of the object itself can be changed.
- → **Methods:** Prevents the method from being overridden by subclasses.
- → **Classes:** Prevents the class from being extended (inherited).

🧹 **`finally` Block**
- → Used in `try-catch` blocks for exception handling.
- → The code inside a `finally` block is always executed, whether an exception is thrown or not.
- → Ideal for cleanup code, like closing database connections, file streams, or network sockets.
- → **Note:** Since Java 7, `try-with-resources` is the preferred way to handle resources that need closing, as it does so automatically.

🗑️ **`finalize()` Method**
- → A method of the `Object` class that is called by the Garbage Collector (GC) just before an object is destroyed.
- → Its purpose is to perform cleanup activities, but its execution is not guaranteed.
- → We never know when the GC will run, so `finalize()` should not be relied upon for critical cleanup tasks.
