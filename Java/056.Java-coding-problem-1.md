## üìù Coding Problem 1: Word Frequency Counter

**Problem Statement:**
Given a `List<String>` (representing words), write a Java program to count the frequency of each word in the list. The output should be a `Map<String, Integer>` where the key is the word and the value is its count.

**Example:**
Input: `List<String> words = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "apple");`
Output: `{"apple": 3, "banana": 2, "orange": 1}`

### Approach 1: Pre-Java 8 (Imperative Style)

**Thought Process:**
Before Java 8, the most straightforward way to solve this problem would be to iterate through the list of words and use a `HashMap` to store the counts. For each word, we would check if it already exists as a key in the map. If it does, we increment its count; otherwise, we add it to the map with a count of 1.

**Implementation:**
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class WordFrequencyPreJava8 {

    public static Map<String, Integer> countWordFrequencies(List<String> words) {
        Map<String, Integer> wordFrequencies = new HashMap<>();

        for (String word : words) {
            // Get the current count, or 0 if the word is not yet in the map
            Integer count = wordFrequencies.get(word);
            if (count == null) {
                wordFrequencies.put(word, 1); // First occurrence
            } else {
                wordFrequencies.put(word, count + 1); // Increment count
            }
        }
        return wordFrequencies;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> words = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "apple");
        Map<String, Integer> frequencies = countWordFrequencies(words);
        System.out.println("Word Frequencies (Pre-Java 8): " + frequencies);
    }
}
```

### Approach 2: Post-Java 8 (Functional Style with Streams)

**Thought Process:**
Java 8's Stream API, especially with `Collectors.groupingBy()`, provides a very concise and declarative way to solve this problem. We can stream the list of words and then group them by their identity, counting the occurrences of each word.

**Implementation:**
```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.function.Function;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class WordFrequencyPostJava8 {

    public static Map<String, Integer> countWordFrequencies(List<String> words) {
        return words.stream()
                    .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(
                        Function.identity(), // Group by the word itself
                        Collectors.summingInt(e -> 1) // Count occurrences
                    ));
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> words = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "apple");
        Map<String, Integer> frequencies = countWordFrequencies(words);
        System.out.println("Word Frequencies (Post-Java 8): " + frequencies);
    }
}
```

### Discussion on Approaches:

- ‚Üí **Readability:** The Java 8 Stream API approach is generally considered more readable and concise for this type of data transformation, as it expresses *what* needs to be done rather than *how* (declarative vs. imperative).
- ‚Üí **Conciseness:** The Stream API solution requires fewer lines of code.
- ‚Üí **Performance:** For small to medium datasets, the performance difference is often negligible. For very large datasets, the Stream API can potentially leverage parallel processing (using `parallelStream()`), though this comes with its own overhead and considerations.
- ‚Üí **Maintainability:** Both are maintainable, but the Stream API can be easier to reason about for complex transformations once familiar with the paradigm.
- ‚Üí **Error Handling:** Both approaches handle basic cases. For more robust solutions (e.g., handling null words, case-insensitivity), additional logic would be added to both.
