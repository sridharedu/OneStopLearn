🎛️ **Collectors.teeing()**
- → A new static method in the `Collectors` class that allows collecting from a stream using two downstream collectors, then merging their results using a `BiFunction`.
- → **Use Case:** When you need to perform two different collecting operations on the same stream in a single pass.
- → **Parameters:**
  - → `downstream1`: The first collector.
  - → `downstream2`: The second collector.
  - → `merger`: A `BiFunction` to merge the results of the two collectors.
```java
// Example: Calculate the sum and count of numbers in a single pass
record Result(long sum, long count) {}

Result result = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    .collect(Collectors.teeing(
        Collectors.summingLong(i -> i), // Downstream 1: sum
        Collectors.counting(),          // Downstream 2: count
        Result::new                     // Merger: combine sum and count
    ));
// result will be Result[sum=15, count=5]
```
