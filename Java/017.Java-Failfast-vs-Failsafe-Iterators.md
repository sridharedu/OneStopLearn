⚡ **Fail-Fast vs. Fail-Safe Iterators**

- → **Fail-Fast Iterators**
  - → **Source:** Provided by traditional collection classes like `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, and `HashMap`.
  - → **Behavior:** Throws a `ConcurrentModificationException` if the collection is structurally modified (add, remove) after the iterator is created, by any means other than the iterator's own `remove()` method.
  - → **Environment:** This happens in both single-threaded and multi-threaded scenarios.
  - → **Goal:** To alert the developer about potential concurrency issues immediately.

- → **Fail-Safe Iterators**
  - → **Source:** Provided by concurrent collection classes like `CopyOnWriteArrayList` and `ConcurrentHashMap`.
  - → **Behavior:** Does **not** throw `ConcurrentModificationException`. They operate on a snapshot or a clone of the collection.
  - → **Trade-off:** The iterator might not reflect the most up-to-date state of the collection after it was created.
  - → **Goal:** To ensure iteration can complete without interruption, even if the underlying collection is being modified.
