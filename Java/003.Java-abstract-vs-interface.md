🎨 **Abstract Class**
- → A class that must be declared `abstract` if it includes at least one abstract method.
- → If a class extends an abstract class, it must implement all its abstract methods or be declared abstract itself.
- → Can contain a mix of methods with and without implementation.
```java
abstract class Shape {
    // Concrete method
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a shape.");
    }
    // Abstract method
    abstract double getArea();
}
```

 blueprint **Interface**
- → A contract where all methods are implicitly `public` and `abstract`.
- → The class that `implements` the interface must provide implementations for all its methods.
```java
interface Rotatable {
    void rotate(); // public abstract by default
}
```

⚖️ **Key Differences**
- → **Inheritance:** A class can `extend` only one abstract class.
- → **Implementation:** A class can `implement` multiple interfaces.
- → **Methods:** Abstract classes can have implemented methods; interfaces traditionally cannot (before Java 8 `default` methods).
