🔑 **`final` Keyword**
- → A modifier that can be applied to variables, methods, and classes.
- → **Variables:** Makes the variable a constant. Its value cannot be changed once assigned.
- → **Object References:** The reference variable cannot be reassigned to a new object, but the state of the object itself can be changed.
- → **Methods:** Prevents the method from being overridden by subclasses.
- → **Classes:** Prevents the class from being extended (inherited).

🧹 **`finally` Block**
- → Used in `try-catch` blocks for exception handling.
- → The code inside a `finally` block is always executed, whether an exception is thrown or not.
- → Ideal for cleanup code, like closing database connections, file streams, or network sockets.
- → **Note:** Since Java 7, `try-with-resources` is the preferred way to handle resources that need closing, as it does so automatically.

🗑️ **`finalize()` Method**
- → A method of the `Object` class that is called by the Garbage Collector (GC) just before an object is destroyed.
- → Its purpose is to perform cleanup activities, but its execution is not guaranteed.
- → We never know when the GC will run, so `finalize()` should not be relied upon for critical cleanup tasks.
