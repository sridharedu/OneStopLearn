## üìù Coding Problem 11: Filter a List of Objects based on a Property

**Problem Statement:**
Given a `List` of `Person` objects (from Problem 10), filter out and return a new list containing only people older than a certain age.

**Example:**
Input: `List<Person> people = [Person("Alice", 30), Person("Bob", 25), Person("Charlie", 35)];`, `ageThreshold = 30`
Output: `[Person{name='Charlie', age=35}]`

---

### Helper Class: `Person` (Same as Problem 10)
```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Person{name='" + name + "', age=" + age + "}";
    }
}
```

### Approach 1: Pre-Java 8 (Imperative Style - Loop and new List)

**Thought Process:**
Before Java 8, filtering a list involved iterating through it, checking a condition for each element, and adding elements that satisfy the condition to a new list.

**Implementation:**
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class FilterPeoplePreJava8 {

    public static List<Person> filterPeopleByAge(List<Person> people, int ageThreshold) {
        List<Person> filteredPeople = new ArrayList<>();
        for (Person person : people) {
            if (person.getAge() > ageThreshold) {
                filteredPeople.add(person);
            }
        }
        return filteredPeople;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Person> people = Arrays.asList(
            new Person("Alice", 30),
            new Person("Bob", 25),
            new Person("Charlie", 35),
            new Person("David", 40)
        );

        int ageThreshold = 30;
        List<Person> olderPeople = filterPeopleByAge(people, ageThreshold);
        System.out.println("People older than " + ageThreshold + " (Pre-Java 8): " + olderPeople);
    }
}
```

### Approach 2: Post-Java 8 (Functional Style - Stream `filter()`)

**Thought Process:**
Java 8's Stream API provides a `filter()` intermediate operation that takes a `Predicate` (a functional interface) as an argument. This allows for a very concise and declarative way to filter elements.

**Implementation:**
```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class FilterPeoplePostJava8 {

    public static List<Person> filterPeopleByAge(List<Person> people, int ageThreshold) {
        return people.stream()
                    .filter(person -> person.getAge() > ageThreshold) // Filter using a lambda predicate
                    .collect(Collectors.toList()); // Collect the filtered elements into a new list
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Person> people = Arrays.asList(
            new Person("Alice", 30),
            new Person("Bob", 25),
            new Person("Charlie", 35),
            new Person("David", 40)
        );

        int ageThreshold = 30;
        List<Person> olderPeople = filterPeopleByAge(people, ageThreshold);
        System.out.println("People older than " + ageThreshold + " (Post-Java 8): " + olderPeople);
    }
}
```

### Discussion on Approaches:

- ‚Üí **Readability & Conciseness:** The Java 8 Stream API approach is significantly more concise and often considered more readable for filtering operations, as it clearly expresses the intent (`filter`) rather than the mechanics of iteration.
- ‚Üí **Maintainability:** The Stream API approach is highly maintainable. If the filtering logic becomes more complex, the lambda expression can be easily modified or replaced with a separate `Predicate` object.
- ‚Üí **Performance:** For simple filtering, the performance difference between the two approaches is often negligible. The Stream API might have some overhead for very small lists, but for larger datasets, it can potentially leverage parallel processing (`parallelStream()`) for better performance.
- ‚Üí **Immutability:** Both approaches return a new list, leaving the original list unchanged.
