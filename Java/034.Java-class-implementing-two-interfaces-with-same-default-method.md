⚔️ **Interfaces with Same Default Method**
- → A class **can** implement two interfaces that have a default method with the same signature, but with a condition.
- → **The Diamond Problem:** If a class simply implements both interfaces, it results in a compilation error because the compiler doesn't know which default implementation to inherit.
- → **The Solution:** The implementing class **must override** the conflicting default method and provide its own implementation. This resolves the ambiguity.
```java
interface A {
    default void m1() { System.out.println("A"); }
}
interface X {
    default void m1() { System.out.println("X"); }
}

class B implements A, X {
    // This override is mandatory to resolve the conflict
    @Override
    public void m1() {
        System.out.println("B's implementation");
        // Optionally, you can even call a specific one:
        // A.super.m1();
    }
}
```
