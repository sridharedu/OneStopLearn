↔️ **HashMap vs. LinkedHashMap**

- → **`HashMap`**
  - → Does **not** guarantee the order of elements.
  - → The iteration order can change over time as new elements are added.

- → **`LinkedHashMap`**
  - → Maintains the **insertion order** of elements.
  - → When you iterate over a `LinkedHashMap`, the elements will appear in the order in which they were added.
  - → It does this by maintaining a doubly-linked list connecting all of its entries.
