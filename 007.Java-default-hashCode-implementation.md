ðŸ”¢ **Default hashCode() Implementation**
- â†’ If a class does not override the `hashCode()` method, it uses the default implementation from the `Object` class.
- â†’ This default implementation returns an integer that typically represents the object's memory address.
- â†’ Therefore, if you don't provide a custom `hashCode()` method, the value returned will be based on the memory location of that specific object.
