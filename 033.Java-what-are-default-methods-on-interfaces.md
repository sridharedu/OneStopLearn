🛡️ **Default Methods in Interfaces**
- → A method in an interface that has an implementation.
- → Introduced in Java 8 to allow adding new methods to existing interfaces without breaking implementing classes.
- → **Problem Solved:** Before Java 8, adding a new abstract method to an interface would force all implementing classes to provide an implementation, otherwise, they would fail to compile.
- → **Solution:** With `default` methods, you can add new functionality with a default implementation.
- → Implementing classes can choose to override the default method or just use the default behavior.
