## üìù Coding Problem 12: Map a List of Objects to a List of their Properties

**Problem Statement:**
Given a `List` of `Person` objects (from Problem 10), extract and return a new list containing only the names of these people.

**Example:**
Input: `List<Person> people = [Person("Alice", 30), Person("Bob", 25), Person("Charlie", 35)];`
Output: `["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]`

---

### Helper Class: `Person` (Same as Problem 10)
```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Person{name='" + name + "', age=" + age + "}";
    }
}
```

### Approach 1: Pre-Java 8 (Imperative Style - Loop and new List)

**Thought Process:**
Before Java 8, transforming a list of objects into a list of one of their properties involved iterating through the original list, accessing the desired property for each object, and adding it to a new list.

**Implementation:**
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MapPeopleNamesPreJava8 {

    public static List<String> getPersonNames(List<Person> people) {
        List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
        for (Person person : people) {
            names.add(person.getName());
        }
        return names;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Person> people = Arrays.asList(
            new Person("Alice", 30),
            new Person("Bob", 25),
            new Person("Charlie", 35)
        );

        List<String> names = getPersonNames(people);
        System.out.println("Person Names (Pre-Java 8): " + names);
    }
}
```

### Approach 2: Post-Java 8 (Functional Style - Stream `map()`)

**Thought Process:**
Java 8's Stream API provides the `map()` intermediate operation, which is specifically designed for transforming elements from one type to another. It takes a `Function` (a functional interface) as an argument, which defines how each element should be transformed.

**Implementation:**
```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class MapPeopleNamesPostJava8 {

    public static List<String> getPersonNames(List<Person> people) {
        return people.stream()
                    .map(Person::getName) // Map each Person object to their name using a method reference
                    .collect(Collectors.toList()); // Collect the transformed elements into a new list
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Person> people = Arrays.asList(
            new Person("Alice", 30),
            new Person("Bob", 25),
            new Person("Charlie", 35)
        );

        List<String> names = getPersonNames(people);
        System.out.println("Person Names (Post-Java 8): " + names);
    }
}
```

### Discussion on Approaches:

- ‚Üí **Readability & Conciseness:** The Java 8 Stream API approach is significantly more concise and often considered more readable for transformation operations. The use of a method reference (`Person::getName`) makes the intent very clear.
- ‚Üí **Maintainability:** The Stream API approach is highly maintainable. If the transformation logic becomes more complex, the lambda expression or method reference can be easily modified.
- ‚Üí **Performance:** For simple mapping, the performance difference between the two approaches is often negligible. The Stream API might have some overhead for very small lists, but for larger datasets, it can potentially leverage parallel processing (`parallelStream()`) for better performance.
- ‚Üí **Immutability:** Both approaches return a new list, leaving the original list unchanged.
