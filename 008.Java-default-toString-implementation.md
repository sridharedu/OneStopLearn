ðŸ“œ **Default toString() Implementation**
- â†’ When you print an object of a class that hasn't overridden `toString()`, the default implementation from the `Object` class is used.
- â†’ This default method returns a string with the following format: `ClassName@HexadecimalHashCode`.
- â†’ The part after the `@` symbol is the hexadecimal representation of the object's hash code, which is typically derived from its memory address.
- â†’ If you override `toString()`, the custom implementation you provide will be used instead.
