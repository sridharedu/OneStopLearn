✨ **Reset vs Revert**
- → **`git reset`:**
    - → Allows resetting the HEAD to a particular commit.
    - → All subsequent commits after the target commit are effectively removed from the history.
    - → This means those changes are gone from the commit history.
- → **`git revert`:**
    - → Creates a *new commit* that undoes the changes of specified commits.
    - → It does not remove the original commits from the history.
    - → If you revert commits 4 and 5 to go back to the state of commit 3, it creates a new commit that undoes the changes of 4 and 5, and the HEAD points to this new commit.
    - → Preferred over `reset` when you want to undo changes while preserving the commit history.
