✨ **Typical Git Workflow**
- → **Start:** Either create a new remote repository or clone an existing one.
- → **Local Copy:** Cloning a project creates a local copy on your machine.
- → **Make Changes:** Modify files in your local repository.
- → **Stage Changes:** Add modified files to the staging area (`git add`).
- → **Commit Changes:** Commit staged changes (`git commit`). A new commit ID is created, and the HEAD always points to the latest commit.
- → **Push Changes:** Push committed changes to the remote repository (`git push`) to share with other developers.
- → **Pull Changes:** Use `git pull` or `git fetch` to get the latest changes from the remote repository to your local repository.
