✨ **Fetch vs Pull**
- → **`git fetch`:**
    - → Retrieves only the list of changes and differences that happened in the remote repository.
    - → It does not fetch the actual changed files to the local repository.
- → **`git pull`:**
    - → Fetches the actual changes (files) from the remote repository to the local repository on your machine.
    - → It is essentially a `git fetch` followed by a `git merge`.
