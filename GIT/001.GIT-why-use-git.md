✨ **Why Use Git**
- → Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS).
- → The entire project is downloaded to the local machine, allowing offline work.
- → It is free and open source.
- → It is fast and lightweight due to working with a local repository.
- → It is very secure, using secured hashing mechanisms for communication between local and remote repositories.
- → Makes pushing/pulling changes and creating branches super simple.
