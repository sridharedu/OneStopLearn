Format this Java topic into compact, interview-style developer notes.
Use .md format with no headers or footers.
Each section should start with a minimal icon and bolded title on the same line.
After that, list each point using - → bullets — one line per point, no merging.
Keep it tight and scannable.
Show code examples in fenced java blocks.
Don’t include any explanations before or after the notes.
ensure that all generated content is comprehensive and includes all necessary information from an interview perspective, without truncation.
