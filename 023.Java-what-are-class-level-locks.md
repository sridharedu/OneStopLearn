🏛️ **Class-Level Locks**

- → Every class in Java has a unique lock associated with its `Class` object.
- → When a thread executes a `synchronized static` method, it acquires this **class-level lock**.
- → While this lock is held, no other thread can enter *any other* `synchronized static` method of the same class.
- → This is different from an object-level lock, which only locks the specific instance of the class.
