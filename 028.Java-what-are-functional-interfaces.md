ðŸ§© **Functional Interfaces**
- â†’ An interface with exactly one abstract method.
- â†’ Can have any number of `default` or `static` methods.
- â†’ **Examples:** `Runnable` (with `run()`), `Comparator` (with `compare()`).
- â†’ Can be marked with the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation, which causes a compile-time error if more than one abstract method is added.
- â†’ A prerequisite for an interface to be represented as a lambda expression.
