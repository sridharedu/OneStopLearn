⚡ **Concurrent Collections**

- → A set of collection classes designed specifically for use in multi-threaded environments.

🐢 **Traditional Collections (`ArrayList`, `HashMap`)**
- → When used in multi-threaded contexts (even when wrapped with `Collections.synchronized...`), they use a single lock for the entire object.
- → This means only one thread can access the collection at a time, causing performance bottlenecks.
- → They use **fail-fast iterators**, which throw a `ConcurrentModificationException` if the collection is modified while being iterated over.

🚀 **Concurrent Collections (The Solution)**

- → **`CopyOnWriteArrayList` / `CopyOnWriteArraySet`**
  - → **Strategy:** When a modification occurs, a fresh copy of the underlying array is made. All subsequent reads see the old copy until the write is complete.
  - → **Benefit:** Allows multiple threads to read the collection without any locking. Writes are expensive, but reads are fast and safe.
  - → **Iterators:** They provide **fail-safe iterators**. These iterators work on a snapshot of the collection at the time the iterator was created and do not throw `ConcurrentModificationException`.

- → **`ConcurrentHashMap`**
  - → **Strategy:** Implements a more sophisticated locking mechanism called **fine-grained locking** (or lock striping).
  - → **Benefit:** Instead of locking the entire map, it locks only the specific segment or "bucket" that is being modified. This allows multiple threads to write to different parts of the map simultaneously, greatly improving concurrency.
