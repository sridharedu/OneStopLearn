✨ **Distributed Transactions**
- → A distributed transaction, also known as a Global transaction or an XA transaction, typically spans across different databases or even resources like messaging brokers.
- → **Example:** Money transfer between two different banks, where money deducted from one account must be safely transferred to another account or database.
- → This could also be within an organization, where applications use multiple databases and all work must be done within one single transaction.

⚙️ **Components**
- → **Transaction Manager:** Responsible for communication between the application and all resource managers.
- → **Resource Managers:** Know how to get work done by the underlying resources, like databases or messaging brokers.

🔄 **Two-Phase Commit (2PC)**
- → A mechanism used in distributed transactions where the entire transaction gets done in two phases.
- → **Phase 1 (Prepare Phase):**
    - → Each participating resource manager writes all records to a local temporary location.
    - → The transaction manager ensures all resource managers have written the data to a temporary location.
    - → Resource managers communicate any errors or an "OK" status to the transaction manager.
- → **Phase 2 (Commit/Rollback Phase):**
    - → The transaction manager checks if all resource managers are "OK".
    - → If all are "OK", it instructs each resource manager to commit everything they have written to the temporary location.
    - → If there is an issue, it asks all resource managers to roll back.

📝 **Summary**
- → Distributed transactions ensure that applications using multiple data sources can achieve an "all or nothing" outcome.
- → Everything should happen within the transaction boundary.
- → This is achieved using transaction managers and resource managers, employing the Two-Phase Commit mechanism.
