📦 **Spring Boot Starters**
- → Convenient dependency descriptors for Spring and related technologies.
- → Provide a one-stop-shop for all necessary dependencies.

⚙️ **How Starters Work**
- → Essentially Maven/Gradle dependency POMs.
- → Contain a collection of other dependencies.
- → Including a starter brings in all necessary transitive dependencies for a feature.

🌟 **Common Spring Boot Starters**
- → `spring-boot-starter-web`: For web (RESTful) applications using Spring MVC; uses Tomcat.
- → `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`: For Spring Data JPA with Hibernate.
- → `spring-boot-starter-security`: For Spring Security.
- → `spring-boot-starter-test`: For testing (JUnit, Mockito, Spring Test).
- → `spring-boot-starter-actuator`: For production-ready features (monitoring, management).
- → `spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf`: For web apps using Thymeleaf.
- → `spring-boot-starter-jdbc`: For JDBC with HikariCP.

✅ **Benefits of Using Starters**
- → **Simplified Dependency Management:** No worries about compatible library versions.
- → **Reduced Build Configuration:** Less XML/Groovy in build files.
- → **Faster Development:** Quick setup with common configurations.
- → **Consistency:** Promotes consistent dependency usage across projects.
