ðŸŽ¯ **What is AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)**
- â†’ A programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns.
- â†’ **Cross-cutting concerns:** Non-functional requirements (e.g., security, logging, transaction management, profiling) that are typically spread across multiple layers and modules of an application.
- â†’ In AOP, an **aspect** is the key unit, similar to how an object is the key unit in OOP.
- â†’ An aspect is a specialized class that addresses a specific cross-cutting concern.
- â†’ Aspects can be applied to classes and objects at runtime.
- â†’ **Advantages of AOP:**
  - â†’ **Addresses Cross-Cutting Concerns:** Centralizes common non-functional requirements.
  - â†’ **Reusability:** Once developed, an aspect can be reused across different classes and applications.
  - â†’ **Quick Development:** Developers can focus on business logic without worrying about non-functional requirements.
  - â†’ **Specialization:** Allows developers to specialize in specific concerns (e.g., security aspect, logging aspect).
  - â†’ **Runtime Control:** Aspects can be enabled or disabled at runtime through configuration.
- â†’ Popular AOP frameworks in Java include Spring AOP and AspectJ.
- â†’ Spring AOP has its own implementation and can also work with AspectJ.
