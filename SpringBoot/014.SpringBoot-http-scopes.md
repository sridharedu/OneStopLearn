🌐 **HTTP Scopes**
- → Different Spring bean HTTP context scopes: Request, Session, and Global.

➡️ **Request Scope**
- → A new bean instance created for every incoming HTTP request.

➡️ **Session Scope**
- → Only one bean instance used across a session.
- → Same bean instance used for multiple HTTP requests and responses within a given session.

➡️ **Global Scope (Global Session)**
- → Makes sense only if using Portlets within the application.
- → Applies across portlets, like a global session.
- → Same bean used across this global session or Portlets.
