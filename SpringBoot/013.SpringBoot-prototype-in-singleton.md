ðŸ”„ **Prototype in Singleton**
- â†’ When a prototype-scoped bean is injected into a singleton-scoped bean, the prototype bean is instantiated only once.
- â†’ This happens during the singleton bean's creation, and the same instance of the prototype bean is reused for all subsequent calls.
- â†’ To get a new instance of the prototype bean each time it's requested from within a singleton, you need to use a method injection or `ObjectFactory`/`Provider`.
- â†’ **Method Injection (Lookup Method):** Define an abstract method in the singleton bean that returns the prototype bean. Spring will override this method to return a new instance each time.
```java
@Component
@Scope("singleton")
public abstract class SingletonBean {
    public abstract PrototypeBean getPrototypeBean();
}

@Component
@Scope("prototype")
public class PrototypeBean {
    // ...
}
```
- â†’ **`ObjectFactory` or `Provider`:** Inject `ObjectFactory<PrototypeBean>` or `Provider<PrototypeBean>` into the singleton bean. Call `getObject()` or `get()` on it to retrieve a new instance.
```java
@Component
@Scope("singleton")
public class SingletonBean {
    @Autowired
    private ObjectFactory<PrototypeBean> prototypeBeanObjectFactory;

    public PrototypeBean getNewPrototypeBean() {
        return prototypeBeanObjectFactory.getObject();
    }
}

@Component
@Scope("prototype")
public class PrototypeBean {
    // ...
}
```
