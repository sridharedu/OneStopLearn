ðŸŒ± **Spring Bean Scopes**
- â†’ Two main Spring bean scopes: Singleton and Prototype.

ðŸ”„ **Singleton Scope**
- â†’ Only one instance of a bean created for the entire IoC container.
- â†’ Same instance injected wherever required.
- â†’ Default scope.

ðŸ”„ **Prototype Scope**
- â†’ Multiple instances of beans created and injected wherever required.

ðŸ¤” **Which to Use and Why?**
- â†’ **Singleton:** Use if application needs statelessness or if classes/beans are stateless (e.g., controllers, DAOs).
- â†’ **Prototype:** Use if beans have state.
- â†’ If stateful beans are Singleton, data can be corrupted across multiple threads.
- â†’ Prototype avoids multi-threading issues with state because each thread gets its own bean instance.
