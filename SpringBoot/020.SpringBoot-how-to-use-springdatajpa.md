🛠️ **How to use Spring Data JPA**
- → Add `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` dependency to your Spring Boot application.
- → Add the appropriate database driver dependency (e.g., MySQL Connector, Oracle driver) to `pom.xml`.
- → Define a model class (entity) to represent a database table, annotated with JPA annotations like `@Entity`, `@Id`, etc.
- → Create a repository interface that extends one of the repository interfaces from Spring Data JPA (e.g., `JpaRepository`).
- → Specify the entity type and the primary key type in the repository interface (e.g., `JpaRepository<YourEntity, Long>`).
- → Use this repository interface in controllers or other layers to perform CRUD operations.
- → Define finder methods by simply declaring abstract methods in the repository interface (e.g., `findByFirstName(String firstName)`).
- → Spring Boot automatically creates a data source and all required beans based on dependencies and `application.properties`.
- → Spring Data JPA dynamically generates an implementation for the repository interface at runtime.
