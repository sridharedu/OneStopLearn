❌ **Problems with Traditional Spring**
- → Used to face issues with extensive XML or Java-based configuration.
- → Cumbersome to maintain applications over time due to configuration.
- → Had to manually include all required modules/dependencies in Maven `pom.xml` or Gradle build file.
- → Ensured compatibility across modules (Core, MVC, DAO, ORM) when moving between versions.
- → Manually deployed applications to external web containers (Tomcat) or application servers (WebLogic, WebSphere).
