ðŸ’¾ **Two Levels of Caching in Hibernate**
- â†’ Hibernate supports caching at two levels:
  - â†’ **Level One Cache (L1 Cache):**
    - â†’ Operates at the Hibernate `Session` level.
    - â†’ Enabled by default and always present.
    - â†’ Cache is specific to a single Hibernate `Session`.
    - â†’ Data loaded from the database is stored in this cache for the current session.
    - â†’ Subsequent requests for the same data within the *same* session will retrieve it from L1 cache, avoiding database hits.
    - â†’ Not shared across different sessions or users.
  - â†’ **Level Two Cache (L2 Cache):**
    - â†’ Operates at the `SessionFactory` level.
    - â†’ Requires additional configuration to enable.
    - â†’ Cache is shared across multiple Hibernate `Session`s.
    - â†’ Objects cached at this level are accessible by different user sessions.
    - â†’ Significantly improves performance by reducing database access for frequently accessed data across the application.
    - â†’ Needs a caching provider (e.g., Ehcache, Hazelcast) as Hibernate does not have built-in L2 cache implementation.
- â†’ `SessionFactory` is responsible for creating multiple Hibernate `Session`s.
- â†’ L2 cache acts as a common cache for all sessions created by that `SessionFactory`.
- â†’ When L2 cache is configured, a session will first check L2 cache, then L1 cache, and finally the database.
- â†’ Ehcache is a popular and powerful L2 caching provider.
