ðŸŒŠ **What is Cascading**
- â†’ Process of propagating non-select operations (insert, update, delete) from a main object in an association to its child objects.
- â†’ Controlled by the `cascade` element on annotations like `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`.
- â†’ Takes different values:
  - â†’ `CascadeType.PERSIST`: Propagates insert operations.
  - â†’ `CascadeType.MERGE`: Propagates insert or update operations.
  - â†’ `CascadeType.REMOVE`: Deletes child objects when the main object is deleted.
  - â†’ `CascadeType.REFRESH`: Refreshes child objects when the main object is refreshed (using `EntityManager`).
  - â†’ `CascadeType.DETACH`: Detaches child objects when the main object is detached (using `EntityManager`).
  - â†’ `CascadeType.ALL`: Applies all cascade types (persist, merge, remove, refresh, detach).
