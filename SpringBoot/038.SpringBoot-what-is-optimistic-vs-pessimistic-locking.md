✨ **Optimistic vs Pessimistic Locking**
- → Both mechanisms determine how transactions in an application access underlying data in the database.

🛡️ **Optimistic Locking**
- → A specific record in the database table is open for all user sessions or transactions.
- → No database records are explicitly locked.
- → Relies on a `version number` or `timestamp` column added to each table.
- → When a transaction reads data, it also reads the version number/timestamp.
- → If another transaction updates the same record, it updates the version number/timestamp.
- → Before an update, the first transaction checks if the initially read version number/timestamp matches the current one in the database.
- → If they don't match, it means another transaction updated the data, and the current transaction must discard or redo its work by re-reading the data.
- → **Assumption:** It's optimistic that another transaction will not update the data.
- → **Use Case:** Very helpful when the application deals with a lot of reads and few updates.

🔒 **Pessimistic Locking**
- → The application explicitly locks records, a record, or even the entire table for read/write operations.
- → Only the current transaction can access the locked data.
- → Other transactions have to wait until the current transaction finishes its work because of the exclusive lock.
- → Provides better data integrity than optimistic locking.
- → **Consideration:** Applications must be carefully designed to avoid deadlock situations.
- → **Transaction Isolation Levels:** Appropriate isolation levels need to be set for pessimistic locking.
    - → `READ_COMMITTED` and `REPEATABLE_READ` are frequently used isolation levels with pessimistic locking.
    - → `READ_UNCOMMITTED` is generally not recommended due to dirty reads.
    - → `SERIALIZABLE` is too restrictive and performs poorly, though it prevents phantom reads.

📝 **Summary**
- → **Optimistic Locking:** Uses version numbers/timestamps; assumes low contention; no explicit locks; suitable for read-heavy, write-light scenarios.
- → **Pessimistic Locking:** Uses explicit database locks; assumes high contention; other transactions wait; provides strong integrity but requires careful deadlock handling.
