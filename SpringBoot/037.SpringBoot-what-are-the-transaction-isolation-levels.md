✨ **Transaction Isolation Levels**
- → Control how multiple transactions running against a database isolate their underlying data.
- → Provide transactional concurrency, allowing multiple transactions to run in parallel without affecting each other.

🚨 **Database Anomalies**
- → **Dirty Reads:**
    - → Occurs when a transaction reads uncommitted data written by another transaction.
    - → If the first transaction rolls back, the data read by the second transaction becomes invalid.
- → **Non-Repeatable Reads:**
    - → Occurs when a transaction reads the same data twice and gets different values because another committed transaction modified the data between the two reads.
- → **Phantom Reads:**
    - → Occurs when a transaction reads a set of rows based on a `WHERE` clause, and then another transaction inserts new rows that satisfy the `WHERE` clause.
    - → When the first transaction re-executes the read, it finds new "phantom" rows.

📊 **Java EE Transaction Isolation Levels**
- → Four standard levels, each preventing different anomalies:
- → **TRANSACTION_READ_UNCOMMITTED:**
    - → Allows reading uncommitted data.
    - → All anomalies can occur: Dirty Reads, Non-Repeatable Reads, Phantom Reads.
- → **TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED:**
    - → Ensures transactions read only committed data.
    - → Prevents Dirty Reads.
    - → Non-Repeatable Reads and Phantom Reads can still occur.
- → **TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ:**
    - → Prevents Dirty Reads and Non-Repeatable Reads.
    - → Phantom Reads can still occur.
    - → Often the default isolation level in many databases.
- → **TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE:**
    - → The most strict isolation level.
    - → The most strict isolation level.
    - → Prevents all anomalies: Dirty Reads, Non-Repeatable Reads, and Phantom Reads.
    - → Least performing due to high concurrency restrictions (e.g., potential table-level locks).
    - → Performance of the application decreases as the isolation level increases (from Read Uncommitted to Serializable).

📝 **Key Takeaways**
- → Database anomalies (Dirty Reads, Non-Repeatable Reads, Phantom Reads) can be avoided using different isolation levels.
- → `SERIALIZABLE` is the most strict and least performing isolation level.
- → `REPEATABLE_READ` is the most popular and frequently used transaction isolation level.
