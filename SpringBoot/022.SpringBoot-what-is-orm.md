↔️ **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)**
- → Process of mapping a Java class to a database table.
- → Maps class fields/members to database table columns.
- → Allows synchronization of class objects into database rows.
- → Developers interact with objects, not directly with SQL.
- → Methods like `save`, `update`, `delete` are invoked on objects.
- → ORM tools automatically generate SQL statements.
- → Uses JDBC internally for insertion, updation, deletion.
- → Eliminates direct SQL interaction and low-level JDBC API usage.
- → Simplifies data persistence by abstracting database operations.
