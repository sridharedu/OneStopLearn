ðŸ§ª **@SpringBootTest**
- â†’ Uses a Spring extension class to run tests instead of a typical JUnit runner.
- â†’ The extension class searches for a class annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`.
- â†’ Uses the `@SpringBootApplication` class to create the entire Spring context for the application.
- â†’ Loads all beans and dependencies before tests are run.
- â†’ Ensures the Spring context and beans are available for testing when `@Test` JUnit annotations are executed.
