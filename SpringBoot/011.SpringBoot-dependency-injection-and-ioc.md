ðŸ’‰ **Dependency Injection (DI) & Inversion of Control (IoC)**
- â†’ When developing software, code is organized across components (classes in Java).
- â†’ Example: `ProductDao` performs database operations, `ProductController` (web layer) uses `ProductDao`.
- â†’ Instead of `ProductController` creating `ProductDao` object, responsibility is delegated to external frameworks like Spring.
- â†’ Spring dynamically creates `ProductDao` object at runtime and injects it into `ProductController`.
- â†’ `ProductController` then uses `ProductDao` within its methods.
- â†’ This process of external components/modules creating and injecting dependencies into required classes is Dependency Injection.
- â†’ Developers can focus on business logic, not object creation.
- â†’ Moving control of object creation from class to external component (like Spring) is Inversion of Control.
- â†’ IoC is a design pattern where object creation control is inverted from application code to an external component.
