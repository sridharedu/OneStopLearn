ðŸ’¸ **What is a Transaction**
- â†’ A transaction is a sequence of operations that are performed as a single logical unit of work.
- â†’ It adheres to an "all or nothing" principle: either all operations within the transaction are completed successfully, or none of them are.
- â†’ **Example (Money Transfer):** If money is deducted from one account but the application crashes before it's credited to another, a transaction ensures the money is not lost.
- â†’ Code is wrapped within a transaction boundary.
- â†’ Changes are not made permanent until a `commit` operation.
- â†’ If something goes wrong, the transaction can be `rolled back` to its previous state.
- â†’ Supports `save points` to roll back to a specific intermediate state within a transaction.
