⏳ **What is Lazy Loading**
- → When a parent object is loaded, associated child objects can be loaded either immediately (eager loading) or on demand (lazy loading).
- → **Eager Loading:** Child objects are fetched immediately along with the parent object.
- → **Lazy Loading:** Child objects are fetched only when they are first accessed in the application.
- → **Example:** If a `Person` object has a one-to-many association with `Phone Numbers` and phone numbers are configured for lazy loading:
  - → When the `Person` object is fetched, only the person's data is loaded.
  - → The list of phone numbers is not fetched from the database at this time.
  - → Only when `person.getPhoneNumbers()` is invoked, the phone numbers are then fetched from the database.
- → **Benefits:** Improves application performance by loading only necessary data, reducing initial load times and memory consumption.
- → **Configuration:** Controlled by the `fetch` attribute on JPA association annotations (e.g., `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`).
  - → `FetchType.EAGER`: Loads associated data immediately.
  - → `FetchType.LAZY`: Loads associated data only when accessed for the first time.
