ðŸ”’ **Transaction ACID Properties**
- â†’ **ACID** stands for:
  - â†’ **Atomicity:** Everything happens or nothing happens. All operations within a transaction are treated as a single, indivisible unit. If any part fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.
  - â†’ **Consistency:** Ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another. Data must always be in a consistent state before and after the transaction.
  - â†’ **Isolation:** Concurrent transactions execute in isolation, meaning the intermediate state of one transaction is invisible to other transactions until it is committed. Prevents interference between concurrent operations.
  - â†’ **Durability:** Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and survive system failures (e.g., power outages, crashes). Committed data is written to non-volatile storage.
