ðŸ‘» **Entity Object States**
- â†’ Entities (domain class objects) go through three states internally when managed by Hibernate:
  - â†’ **Transient State:**
    - â†’ Object is not yet associated with the underlying Hibernate session.
    - â†’ Just created, not yet persisted.
  - â†’ **Persistent State:**
    - â†’ Object is associated with the Hibernate session.
    - â†’ Achieved by invoking `save` on a new object or `find` on an existing record.
    - â†’ Changes to the object are synchronized with the database.
  - â†’ **Detached State:**
    - â†’ Object was previously in a persistent state.
    - â†’ No longer associated with the Hibernate session (e.g., after `close` or `clear` on `EntityManager`).
    - â†’ Still exists in the database.
    - â†’ Can be re-attached to a session by invoking `save` (or `merge`) with another session.
- â†’ When an object is deleted, it moves from persistent to transient state (object exists, but record is gone from DB).
- â†’ Objects in transient or detached states can be garbage collected if not re-associated.
- â†’ Detached objects can be passed across application layers.
