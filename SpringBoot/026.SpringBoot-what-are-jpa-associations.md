ðŸ”— **JPA Associations**
- â†’ Maps relationships between database tables to JPA entities.
- â†’ Allows navigation from one entity to another, with SQL queries (joins) generated by JPA implementation.
- â†’ **Four types of relationships:**
  - â†’ **One-to-One:** A single instance of one entity relates to a single instance of another (e.g., Person and License).
  - â†’ **Many-to-Many:** Multiple instances of one entity relate to multiple instances of another (e.g., Order and Product).
  - â†’ **One-to-Many:** One instance of an entity relates to multiple instances of another (e.g., Customer to Phone Numbers).
  - â†’ **Many-to-One:** Multiple instances of an entity relate to a single instance of another (e.g., Phone Number to Customer).
- â†’ **Relationship Modes:**
  - â†’ **Unidirectional:** Relationship can only be navigated in one direction (e.g., from Customer to Phone Number, but not vice-versa).
  - â†’ **Bidirectional:** Relationship can be navigated in both directions (e.g., from Customer to Phone Number and Phone Number to Customer).
- â†’ Configured using annotations: `@OneToOne`, `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, `@ManyToMany` with various properties.
