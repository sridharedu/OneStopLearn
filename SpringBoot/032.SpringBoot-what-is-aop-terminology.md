ðŸ“š **AOP Terminology**
- â†’ **Aspect:**
  - â†’ A plain Java class marked with `@Aspect` (from AspectJ).
  - â†’ Contains a number of advices and pointcuts.
  - â†’ Addresses a particular cross-cutting concern (e.g., security, transaction management, logging).
- â†’ **Advice:**
  - â†’ A method within an aspect that addresses a part of the cross-cutting concern.
  - â†’ Defines the action to be taken at a join point.
  - â†’ **Spring AOP Advice Types (method level join points only):**
    - â†’ `Before`: Executed before a method call.
    - â†’ `After`: Executed after a method call (regardless of success or exception).
    - â†’ `AfterReturning`: Executed after a method returns successfully.
    - â†’ `AfterThrowing`: Executed after a method throws an exception.
    - â†’ `Around`: Combines `Before` and `After`; executed both before and after a method call.
- â†’ **Join Point:**
  - â†’ A point in the Java program where an advice needs to be applied.
  - â†’ In Spring AOP, join points are limited to method executions.
  - â†’ Could conceptually be a method, field, or constructor (but Spring AOP only supports methods).
- â†’ **Pointcut:**
  - â†’ An expression language (like a regular expression) used to match a particular join point.
  - â†’ Uses a syntax to express where advices should be applied (e.g., `execution(* *..*Service.*(..))`).
  - â†’ Marked with `@Pointcut` annotation.
