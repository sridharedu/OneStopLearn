ðŸ“š **What is JPA**
- â†’ JPA stands for Java Persistence API.
- â†’ It is a standard from Oracle for performing object-relational mapping in Java EE applications.
- â†’ JPA comes with a specification (for vendors) and an API (for developers).
- â†’ Popular JPA providers (implementers of the API) include Hibernate, OpenJPA, EclipseLink.
- â†’ Developers learn one single API, allowing switching between providers without application changes.
- â†’ Hibernate is the most popular JPA provider.
- â†’ JPA API includes classes like `EntityManagerFactory` and `EntityManager`.
- â†’ Uses annotations like `@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id`, `@Column` for mapping Java classes and fields to database tables and columns.
- â†’ Spring Data JPA further abstracts `EntityManagerFactory` and `EntityManager`, simplifying development.
